          "context": "message\nI have been a customer with HSBC for over 20 years, and the service I have got is beyond appalling. I have been waiting for over 18 weeks for my business account to be opened, I have been promised week after week that it will be open next week, so I have waited. I have a time sensitive grant that will run out next week, which I need for my business and has to be put into a business account. I am having to do all the extra work of managing business finances in my current account so it doesn’t get mixed up. No one is giving me any clear answers. You have pushed my business to the edge.\nI feel infuriated with HSBC right now. I’ve been trying to open back accounts for my 2 older children. I have banked with you for many years and my family have worked for you, so I’m loyally trying time keep with you. However I’ve now tried for 6 weeks to open accounts for the children. I’ve had 3 different messages on phone, originally telling me I could now apply online, then no, then to make an appointment, then no. Now your new opening hours mean I actually can’t get them to the bank as you are open for school hours. Very frustrating.\n\"I applied for a bounce back loan in June still waiting now !!!! Complained and all hsbc have said is due to high volume they will be in contact don’t know where to go and I have banked with them for over 30 years !!! \n \n Very poor service\"\nThe worst bank in UK , change from HSBC trust me they never accept nothing even tou had many years ...\n\"Complaint \n Hi ,WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it’s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar\"\nI’ve been offered a business overdraft which I do not want. Have been on hold for over an hour and slowly giving up hope of speaking to anyone. There’s no way of knowing whether I’m next in the queue or have 100’s of people in front of me. All I want to do is reject the overdraft as I know HSBC will charge me for this!!! Really bad show\nmmmm I was considering switching but have had no reply to a question I sent on messenger. After reading some of these comments not sure if I will..... I thought HSBC had a good reputation ????\nTG I got a pre lockdown appointment with Barclays son can close my accounts with HSBC...and open new one....HSBC fraud department admits they have made a mistake but only the dispute department can reverse the transaction...but they cant get hold of them....I have spent 5 hours on hold waiting for despute team to answer....they dont because they dont exist....\n\"HSBC A DISPUTE WAS OPEN IN MAY AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. THE PAYMENT WAS MADE ON A CREDIT CARD BY LAW MY REFUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROCESSED BY NOW. \n YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DISGUSTING\"\n@HSBC beyond all reasoning now!! 4 time my husband has tried to call, each time 2 hours getting through!!!! Twice got through! Twice put on hold but actually hung up on!!! This is not acceptable 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 8 hours in total and nothing is done!!!\nHSBC currently due to lockdown to wait and reach the operators from abroad is expensive. So, it would be beneficial if we can arrange a direct call with the operator and then catch up. Otherwise to wait 15-20 minutes is impossible by international calls.\n\"Four times I phoned your dispute team on Monday 1st time waited 50 minutes, 2nd 20 minutes then another 50 minutes finally was answered only to be told that it was not the dispute department even though that was the number they asked me to phone. Young lady tried to help then put me on hold for the dispute department after a hour and 15 minutes gave up. \n Got through yesterday was answered in 50 minutes went through my dispute sent paperwork while on phone and was told they would phone be back today(was on phone just over an hour). Phoned me back today told she couldn’t help me put me on hold for dispute team after over an hour come back and told me to phone another number have asked them to phone me back but not expecting them to just want my money back never mind giving new customers £125 this customer will be moving on after 34 years with HSBC.\"\n\"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November. Consequently I have this week spent a total of 6 hours and 10 minutes in phone calls with Barclaycard over a 4 day perios who have also confirmed the information given by HSBC was inaccurate. Subsequently I have once again this afternoon phoned HSBC only to be CUT OFF for the second time after forty minutes. \n \n This has now left me with no other option than to contact:\n 1: The financial ombudsman \n 2. BBC Watchdog\n 3: A researcher I know personally who works for a well known TV show that exposes and brings to public attention situations like this.\n \n It's absolutely astounding that all I wanted to do was make a simple balance transfer! \n \n If you are going to employ cheap monkeys to operate a business, you can expect to turn into a zoo, which judging by the reviews here, you've succeeded. \n \n Absolutely appalling service.\"\nHSBC Bloody useless bank! Ignore these supposedly positive posts, I cannot understand how unresponsive they are, don't deserve to be in business considering the way they treat, or, rather ignore their customers. Been waiting nearly 13 weeks for bounce back loan, chased sign-off docs, signed them three weeks ago, was told money would be in account within 48 hours, still nothing! AND that is after chasing it up upteen times, Bank Manager been on the case for last almost 2 weeks, he's getting no-where, apparently. Anyone thinking of joining this bank should think twice, as I know lots of people leaving it! I have been with the bank for 35 years, when it was Midland Bank, since becoming HSBC, it has slowly gone down hill to an incompetent mess!\nWell HSBC are you really helping people and businesses out? I applied for my bounce back loan over 2 months ago, wrote multiple emails, spent hours on the phone and still nothing! You are letting small business to fail in these difficult times! Every other week I get the same answer to check my emails, but nothing is happening!\n\"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November.

I want to register so I can start to invest money in my new current account and also one or more savings accounts and I have no telephone security number which I must have to proceed. Visited a branch and was told it would be posted to me, and nothing has arrived, phoned the number advertised on your website several times, which is not a good experience and expensive, and twice spoke to an agent who said it had been posted, and still nothing has arrived. I am starting to think I have made a mistake in starting the switching process and I must say your customer service could and should be improved.\n\"25 minutes on the phone to some GUY I can barely understand\n Locked out of online banking\n Locked out of telephone\n EVEN AFTER 25 minutes NO PROGRESS\n THEN HE CUTS ME OFFTHE LINE\n YOU COULD NOT MAKE IT UP\n Take your money elsewhere and save the heartache\n HSBC you are a JOKE!!\"\nHSBC your customer service is an absolute shambles. I have been waiting over 10 weeks for a response and still nothing. What a joke\nHSBC suddenly switches to 'right on' black rights when it suits there marketing strategy..... YUK\n\"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n \n Got through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!\n \n HSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.\n \n TIME FOR THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMEN!\"\nBarclays. HSBC. Come tomorrow, Friday 24th July it is law to wear a face covering in shops, banks and post offices etc. Now for ID purposes, bank staff may ask a person to remove their face covering. Given such, will you be asking those wearing a burka to remove their face coverings for ID purposes, given that such is not a religious item of clothing? Equality must play a part of course.\nTogether against fraud? HSBC allows it and then does nothing to rectify it! I will be moving my accounts when all of this is resolved, that’s if it ever is!\nI also bank with Lloyds, Nationwide and Santander - and I can honestly say HSBC is the SLOWEST and POOREST customer service. I have been waiting for a bounceback loan to come through for a very long time, no word, no email, no letters - totally unnacceptable. This is a government scheme and the bank should sort this out as a matter of priority. Why does it take 2 hours for someone to answer the phone, and when they do they don't know how to help?? The lockdown excuse is wearing thin now. Most people are back at work! Terrible.\nHSBC my wife tried to log on to business banking as usual on Sunday but it was immediately rejected saying that there were too many failed attempts. She followed the process including printing a form, completing it, taking a photo and uploading it. She has not heard from you. So this afternoon she called the main HSBC number for help. After 60 minutes of being on hold she ended the call. She then called the number that was on the form, despite being continually informed that she was in a priority queue, after 90 minutes of being on hold, she ended the call. That is two and half hours of lost time. We have never experienced such a poor service from any organisation before. What do you suggest?\n\"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November.

After numerous telephone calls spending hours on the phone, mostly on hold im informed that im unable to open a business account 21-10-2020. Ive been a customer for 20 years. The email suggested that a credit check was undertaken for borrowing !!! I do not wish to borrow any money or require any funding. Im now self employed new business and busy working unable to sped hours on hold waiting for answers being put through to this department that department. Ive tried the appeal on line form and it continually times out. I require an account so that my clients can pay me. Totally disgusted with the whole process. I tried to book an appointment with a local bank shut on Saturdays and 4pm in the week (i have to work). I spoke to a guy in business this morning and he tells me the application has been closed. Extremely annoyed. HSBC please contact me regarding opening an account to place funds into ASAP.\nWORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it’s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar\n\"Dear HSBC\n \n I have been on hold now for an hour with your telephone service. This is not an exaggeration. \n \n Please would you arrange for a member of staff to answer the telephone.\"\nOur so called HSBC gold plated pension after clawback is not worth a brass tack!\nChanging Limited Liability debts to a sole trade account isn't fraud then HSBC? It's about time someone went public with your disgraceful and fraudulent activities. Not to mention laughable bounce back loan application timeframe.\n\"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n \n Got through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!\n \n HSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.\n \n TIME FOR THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMEN!\"\nHad enough of hsbc (not even worth caps lock!) You are not helpful in the slightest!\nI don't need HSBC to tell me how to budget thank you, although I have had many financial reviews with HSBC. Pity their own Financial Planning Managers never mentioned HSBC would keep 22% of my small company pension for themselves when I reach State Pension age. I am a loyal employee with 43 years' service and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known. Shame on you HSBC. Do the right thing and get rid of this unfair out if date practice like the others have, CLAWBACK has no place in this modern world.\nIt’s rare I complain but feel frustrated. I’ve been to my local HSBC branch in Meadowhall only to find that now they are closed on a Saturday! Most people who are working can’t get to branch during the reduced hours on a Monday to Friday. Saturday is the only day I can get to pay in cash. It wouldn’t be so bad if there was a paying in machine outside the branch but there isn’t! How about close one day in the week and open on a Saturday to offer a service to working people.\nHSBC - my husband (who doesn’t have Facebook) is at his wits end trying to get in touch. Been ringing for days and still waiting an hour later. He has just changed banks to yourself and the switching process is due to complete 6th November but no telephone banking number so can’t register online. Everything apart from that has arrived in the post. I have sent a PM but no response. Please can someone help\nThis is quite frankly sick.Read up on the record of HSBC and it's ethics......NOT much human rights there folks.....\nWORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it’s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar\nI have been a victim of a scam and fraud and HSBC have told me I have to wait ten weeks before I may get my money back!!! This is ludicrous. I'm in my first year of trading as a sole trader and banks are supposed to help you. Instead I'm being punished for working hard. Definitely not leaving my money in my HSBC account again. Learn from your mistakes.\n\"1 hr on the phone to order a new card after a HSBC branch employee made a mistake and failed to order it a week ago, only for todays operator to hang up after an hour of dealing with the mistake.\n \n Still no card ordered. 🤬 \n \n HSBC_UK is there anyone\n competent in your organisation that wants to deal this problem? 😏\"\nShame we didn’t have this advice over 40 years ago and known we were going to have to search down our sofas as Midland Bank/HSBC Staff Pension scheme was going to be “Clawed” back off us. I’m certain had loyal staff known this, or been advised of this from the beginning we would have changed our career paths, I know I would have. It’s a disgrace!\nHSBC customer service is quite frankly disgusting at the moment. Organisations have had 7 months to put measures in place and yet still appallingly slow service is being blamed on COVID-19. Last week took 6 attempts to obtain a redemption statement, by the time it was finally sent the expiry date meant not enough time to complete on a new mortgage so back to square one. New one requested on 24th, here we are 6 days later and still no sign of it. Not good enough.\nI’m with you. I’ve had an account for 40 years. Need to make an important payment. Have spent hours on the phone today - speaking to over 5 members of staff - line gone dead twice. For no reason they’ve decided that they don’t trust the payee despite my assurances that I have triple checked the details. Now suspended access to my bank account. Now saying that can’t make the payment until I’ve gone into a branch and proved my identity. No branches open this weekend. HSBC won’t let me use my account and jeopardising my future for no reason at all. Have put in a complaint but won’t be actioned in time. Disgraceful treatment of a long standing customer.

Their employees budget carefully for retirement only to find that at state pension age HSBC claw money back from their pensioners who then have to budget again because they have less money. HSBC think that it is acceptable because it was ‘clearly communicated’ when we all joined the bank many years ago. Funny that they won’t provide definitive proof of this as these pensioners only found about this ‘state deduction’ as HSBC call it as it started affecting some many years later and after many years of loyal service.

USD &amp; JPY are likely to remain well supported through an initial rise in #volatility caused by swings in sentiment\n\"HSBC 7/8: until late in 2021. This is also the case for most EM economies where some downturns look especially prolonged.\n In U-shaped recovery, we believe that there is likely to be a period of uncertainty as economic rebound takes time to emerge &amp; may offer occasional false hope\"\n\"HSBC 6/8: U-shaped recovery most likely scenario\n  \n Our central case is for a U-shaped recovery. This is aligned with the overwhelmingly negative economic data which looks like it will take some time to bottom out. For most G10 economies, output will not reach its end-2019 level\"\n\"HSBC 5/8: \n 4. ï¼-shape â€” An extended downturn in growth, perhaps prompted by a second wave of containment measures. A \"\"Risk off' mood would ensue. Winners: Gold, JPY, USD, Losers: CAD, AUD, NZD\"\n\"HSBC 4/8: \n 3. V-shape â€” A healthy and reasonable swift rebound in growth. \"\"Risk on-Risk off' is still dominant, as previous FX losers become the winners. Winners: AUD, NZD, CAD, Losers: Gold, USD, JPY, CHF\"\n\"HSBC 3/8: \n 2. U-shape â€” The upswing fails to arrive immediately. FX is driven by the relative health of government finances as markets look for policy to deliver the upswing. Winners: USD, JPY, AUD, NZD, Losers: EUR, CAD, GBP\"\n\"HSBC 2/8: We believe a U-shaped recovery is most likely:\n \n 1. L-shape â€” The global economy fails to rebound even after the easing of #COVIDãƒ¼19 containment measures. FX is driven by the relative health of external positions. Winners: JPY, CHF, Gold, Losers: AUD, NZD, GBP\"\nHSBC 1/8: There is considerable uncertainty as to the future path of the #COVID19 pandemic and the associated economic trajectory. As such, we consider various possible scenarios that could play out and what these may mean for #G10 currencies. https://t.co/dkqzfPsFZG\nHas anyone been paid from HSBC using their personal account without business account being with them?

Went to online chat and your rep whos grammer was terrible could not even help as your fraud team are off for the night!\nHSBC should know all about this. Mexico, Brazil... Biggest fraud in the UK is how HSBC treat 52,000 of their former Midland Bank staff pensioners. They  certainly didn't explain clawback and glibly told people they would get a 2/3 final salary pension. Lies! Now clawing back up to 30% from the lowest paid. Time to do the right thing HSBC and drop clawback. I doubt Ian Stuart, Noel Quinn or anybody in a senior post will ever read this and they certainly seem to only have their own best interests at heart. Interesting that the bank's pension trustees are contacting people to put themselves forward as a pension scheme trustee but have pointedly not contacted any of the clawback campaign committee.\nHSBC is an international bank so call centres can be based anywhere...... stay safe Philippine’s wishing everyone and their families well\n\"Maybe put your call centres in the UK. I never used to believe the bloke I was talking to was really called “Michael” when he had such a shocking level of English. \nHowever, that aside HSBC wrote off a debt to them due to my disability and acted really really kindly and nicely with empathy and compassion, so I am impressed with them. \"\nOkay HSBC might not be the best bank in the country but they are a worldwide bank and when I lived in Canada for 5 years they helped me setup an account over there, so before you lot blast this post, just take a step back and think about the people who work out there in Manila and what it must be like for them right now, even with this Covid pandemic that has put us all into lockdown, these people and the call centres are doing their best in a bad situation, no matter if it’s a bank, your broadband provider, whoever they are working as best as they can, I used to work for a call centre and the amount of abuse that I’ve seen staff take it can have a negative effect on their mental health so give that some consideration please. 👊😊👊\nTHERE IS ALWAYS AN EXCUSE WITH HSBC - FIRST COVID 19 - NOW TYPHOONS - JUST KEEP GOING - SO IF I HAVE TO LIQUIDATE MY ACCOUNT I WILL AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE THE DEBT. BECAUSE IM SICK OF WAITING HOURS ON THE PHONE TO TALK ABOUT THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER\nWatch Netflix HSBC documentary - ethical? NOPE...\nI would love to donate again this year. Unfortunately though HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance. Unfortunately for myself and my staff they have not kept to their word. I know this is a pointless post but just wanted to say they are certainly not all sweetness and light as they are trying to make out\nHow about making some updates to your UK staff pensions.  52,000 suffering outdated, unfair and immoral clawback. Some of the lowest paid staff now having 30% of their already small pension taken back, although you look after the senior managers by only taking back 2% from their high pensions! Time to do the right thing HSBC. Ian Stuart, Noel Quinn take a good look at your group standards and then try applying them to your older and longer serving staff and pensioners. Remove clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk\nThat’s a great job 💐 done by HSBC, hope other local banks can come forward like this and help the nation. \n42 days since applying for a business account with zero progression ... madness HSBC !

My card dispute is 5 months old now, soon I'll give it a name and celebrate its first birthday. Can't wait to leave HSBC!\nHSBC currently due to lockdown to wait and reach the operators from abroad is expensive.

If one method does not work then another should be available even if it takes a while to reply.

Was a great bank 10 years ago, but won't recommend now. Took an hour on the phone to them for a simple reser, now discovered an insane overdraft interest rate targeting poor customers in this climate. Should charge more than 25 pounds a month. I was hit with 50 pound bill. They encourage debt.\nYou talk about dreams but you are destroying mine.. Im heartbroken that you've undervalued my flat by 20,000. I adopted a dog who's owner is now too ill too take him back and I've fallen in love with him but I can't keep him in my flat so I was buying a house which has now fallen through because you have undervalued my flat so much. Please help me and reconsider HSBC\n\"Just had a message from you stating that you have tried to call.

ALSO TOLD ME THAT YOU ARE PRIORITISING NEW CUSTOMERS FOR BOUNCE BANK LOANS SO US LOYAL EXISTING BUSINESS BANK CUSTOMERS ARE NOT CURRENTLY PRIORITY.

Young lady tried to help then put me on hold for the dispute department after a hour and 15 minutes gave up. \nGot through yesterday was answered in 50 minutes went through my dispute sent paperwork while on phone and was told they would phone be back today(was on phone just over an hour).

They don't seem to care, looking at the posts here.

Crap customer service, stupid security questions like \"where did you spend £x two weeks ago last Thursday\". I'm now looking to move banks.\nThis is quite frankly sick.Read up on the record of HSBC and it's ethics......NOT much human rights there folks.....\nI am not having a good experience setting up my new HSBC account and registering on-line.  I want to register so I can start to invest money in my new current account and also one or more savings accounts and I have no telephone security number which I must have to proceed.  Visited a branch and was told it would be posted to me, and nothing has arrived, phoned the number advertised on your website several times, which is not a good experience and expensive, and twice spoke to an agent who said it had been posted, and still nothing has arrived.  I am starting to think I have made a mistake in starting the switching process and I must say your customer service could and should be improved.\nAn hour on chat to try to get a new bank card. An hour on the phone. Then they cancel the wrong card so I have no cards. Sons ill. Grocery delivery will be cancelled and a world of difficulty. The solution? “Borrow some money from a friend.” What has happened to you HSBC? Customer service used to be amazing. Now the wait to speak to someone is horrendous. Chat doesn’t work as they’re doing multiple conversations at once, I’m just waiting for 45 minutes just for someone to acknowledge that I’m waiting. I’m on hold again now, 16 minutes into yet another call to again request that my joint account card is reissued. \nmmmm I was considering switching but have had no reply to a question I sent on messenger. After reading some of these comments not sure if I will..... I thought HSBC had a good reputation ????\nThis is the third credit check HSBC has done on my current account, with  regards to opening my business bank account, never had so many credit checks done on me, left a mark in my credit history you bet they have. This has been going on for 19 weeks, it will be 20 weeks this week. Promise after promise “it’s at quality control, so should be open this week never week at the latest” lies and more lies. Two hours a day I spend on the phone every day getting this sorted, when I should be running my business, to get nothing and the guy today wasn’t even trying to be nice. Bet I get a generic reply to this, because they can’t even face the people they are letting down.\nHi HSBC, I've sent you a message but not heard back - is anyone actually checking your messages?\n**Terrible bank** Stay clear everyone, you will not be happy with their service I can tell you!! I'd not even recommend this shabby set of people to my worst enemy!! Honestly I'd sooner crap in my goggles and blink than ever bank with HSBC again!!..***\nMany foreign students are trying to open their account to HSBC but due to lack of facilities they turn down other banks UK\nHSBC suddenly switches to 'right on' black rights when it suits there marketing strategy.....

In September, believing the bank would by now be contact-able to sort out bank accounts. Over 90 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered, unclear forms to fill out and then a letter sent to the wrong address saying it was done wrong and to phone the original number. Now back waiting on the same phone number again just to get in contact with someone. Such bad service. Unless things are resolved, our organisation will be moving accounts - that is if we can actually get in touch with someone! So bad - avoid if you are a community group :-(\nI’m still on hold since 9am this morning listening to the HSBC music🤷‍♂️\nHSBC telephone banking is an appsalupely useless service its not fit for purpose I think the advisors have fell asleep on the other end of the line.\n\"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November.

I got a conformation email and since have had nothing.  I have spent 7 hours in total listening to the mind warping music on hold and have not spoken to anyone and  have a business account with HSBC. Shocking!\nApplied for BBL with you guys in AUGUST!! Apart from an email confirming my application I've heard nothing! Hours and hours of waiting on the phones for you to answer. The BBL scheme was supposed to be there to help people with their businesses during difficult times. How are you helping exactly? My son did his with Natwest, ten days between application and receiving the money. HSBC are appalling!! \nI feel infuriated with HSBC right now. I’ve been trying to open back accounts for my 2 older children. I have banked with you for many years and my family have worked for you, so I’m loyally trying time keep with you. However I’ve now tried for 6 weeks to open accounts for the children. I’ve had 3 different messages on phone, originally telling me I could now apply online, then no, then to make an appointment, then no. Now your new opening hours mean I actually can’t get them to the bank as you are open for school hours. Very frustrating. \nSo on the 13-10-2020 i applied for a Business bank account (after being made redundant). After numerous telephone calls spending hours on the phone, mostly on hold im informed that im  unable to open a business account 21-10-2020. Ive been a customer for 20 years. The email suggested that a credit check was undertaken for borrowing !!! I do not wish to borrow any money or require any funding. Im now self employed new business and busy working unable to sped hours on hold waiting for answers being put through to this department that department. Ive tried the appeal on line form and it continually times out. I require an account so that my clients can pay me. Totally disgusted with the whole process. I tried to book an appointment with a local bank shut on Saturdays and 4pm in the week (i have to work). I spoke to a guy in business this morning and he tells me the application has been closed. Extremely annoyed. HSBC please contact me regarding opening an account to place funds into ASAP.\nYou're not here to help 50,000 of your own pensioners that you impose pension clawback on! Some of the lowest paid, mainly women, losing over 30% of their hard-worked for pensions, whilst the highest paid and fatcats suffer hardly anything! Not fair and it was not properly explained to the majority of those staff. Imagine retiring on a pension of less than £10,000 a year and then having a third of that taken back simply because you start receiving the meagre State Pension. HSBC your share price might be suffering and you might have issues around the China/USA trade war, plus you might still have issues surrounding money laundering and such like BUT you can still afford to remove the unfairness and inequity of clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk\nIt’s a shame when you say you’re open, but when you call it say, this office is now closed. 🤦🏻‍♀️ worst banking ever. Wish I was left to open the bank account because it would’ve not been HSBC \nBeen waiting over a month for our new business account to be activated! Can't speak to anyone, hold on the phone for hours. Told we will get updates on email and we get nothing. How can a new business survive these tricky times if we can't invoice our jobs??? Can anyone at HSBC actually help me with this?? Not just an answer phone telling me to press number after number to be told they won't discuss business accounts down the bloody phone!!!!!\nThe service I have received from HSBC in India is appalling. No one takes ownership. No one cares patheic\nWell HSBC are you really helping people and businesses out? I applied for my bounce back loan over 2 months ago, wrote multiple emails, spent hours on the phone and still nothing! You are letting small business to fail in these difficult times! Every other week I get the same answer to check my emails, but nothing is happening!\n@HSBC beyond all reasoning now!! 4 time my husband has tried to call, each time 2 hours getting through!!!! Twice got through! Twice put on hold but actually hung up on!!!

Wasting a vast amount of my time and repeatedly giving me the wrong information. \nWhat caused this level of incompetence and uselessness?\"\nVery disappointed with the abysmal customer service at the HSBC in Harrow, London, this afternoon. Two apparent customer service 'assistants' barked at me to queue TWICE from outside the bank because I needed to use two machines inside the bank, to withdraw and deposit money from my accounts! In addition, two of the three deposit machines inside the bank did not work! I refused to queue twice or give any credence to two rude, jumped up, good for nothing customer service agents and as a result HSBC missed out on my deposit and most likely my future business! Perhaps HSBC should divert resources into maintaining their 'self service' machines instead of employing unhelpful assistants that are obsessed with marshalling queues, lost on a deluded mini power trip and have an unnerving propensity to shout at their customers!#SHOCKING-SUB-STANDARD-CUSTOMER-SERVICE!\n\"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.\nWithin 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - £4000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!\nHSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.\nOntop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.\nHSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.\nI HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY GET SHUT DOWN!\"\nI have been a customer with HSBC for over 20 years, and the service I have got is beyond appalling. I have been waiting for over 18 weeks for my business account to be opened, I have been promised week after week that it will be open next week, so I have waited. I have a time sensitive grant that will run out next week, which I need for my business and has to be put into a business account. I am having to do all the extra work of managing business finances in my current account so it doesn’t get mixed up. No one is giving me any clear answers. You have pushed my business to the edge.\nNowadays most of programs are based in Birmingham  centenary square⛲️. HSBC already started to decreasing 🎢 their branches in London & if they continue like this, very soon HSBC Canary Wharf will be in the list of closedown. So HSBC 🇬🇧 need to do same celebrations in London also. \nWhat a joke of a Bank.Had a fraud alert sent to me from HSBC and guess what...... can’t get hold of anyone, just constantly on hold.Moved all the money out of my HSBC account into my Halifax account and to be honest that’s where it will stay.Dreadful service!!!\nHSBC customer service is quite frankly disgusting at the moment. Organisations have had 7 months to put measures in place and yet still appallingly slow service is being blamed on COVID-19. Last week took 6 attempts to obtain a redemption statement, by the time it was finally sent the expiry date meant not enough time to complete on a new mortgage so back to square one. New one requested on 24th, here we are 6 days later and still no sign of it. Not good enough.\nI’m with you.  I’ve had an account for 40 years.  Need to make an important payment.  Have spent hours on the phone today - speaking to over 5 members of staff - line gone dead twice.  For no reason they’ve decided that they don’t trust the payee despite my assurances that I have triple checked the details.  Now suspended access to my bank account.  Now saying that can’t make the payment until I’ve gone into a branch and proved my identity.  No branches open this weekend.  HSBC won’t let me use my account and jeopardising my future for no reason at all.  Have put in a complaint but won’t be actioned in time.  Disgraceful treatment of a long standing customer.  I’m astonished that they would do this.\nWhat a shame you don't put as much effort into helping your loyal pensioners and stop applying Clawback which you shamelessly call a state deduction. Do the right thing HSBC. #midlandclawback\nJust under three hours on hold trying to get through regarding BBLS (5 months and counting) and then I got disconnected once someone answered. Shocking. How anyone has stayed with HSBC as a customer is beyond me. I have emailed you using the response email someone posted below, hoping someone will do the decent thing and respond to me...\nHsbc your telephone and internet service is beyond a joke! Your can’t keep blaming Covid-19 your are the only company I have had such horrendous problems with and your wait time is awful\nI would like to know why HSBC have changed my name on my accounts to a name I have never been and now I am having trouble to sort them out because you want proof of my name to which I have never been but my mortgage is in the right name, all I want is the interest from paying my mortgage off early in a cheque that is in the right name so I can cash it and also why have you changed my name on my sons trust fund to the name I am not or have never been. I have filled in a change of name form over 3 weeks ago, I have given you all the proof you need to see that I am not that name, I have rang you up to have the phone put down on me, I have been in branch 3 times but you keep sending me letters in the name I have NEVER been\nSo disappointed with HSBC.  My daughter has just reported a fraud on her account and has spent two days on the 'phone trying to get it resolved.  \"Halifax\", on the other hand, who were also involved have been fantastic\nI have been trying to contact HSBC for two days. I cannot activate my replacement secure key for online banking, I go in store and they tell me to contact by phone. I've been on the phone twice each time on hold for 2 hours. Also, live chat is not working online. I am effectively frozen out of my business account and cannot access. This is now affecting our business. I need this issue to be fixed now because - payments to make ASAP.\n\"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n\nGot through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes.

I have been waiting for a bounceback loan to come through for a very long time, no word, no email, no letters - totally unnacceptable. This is a government scheme and the bank should sort this out as a matter of priority. Why does it take 2 hours for someone to answer the phone, and when they do they don't know how to help?? The lockdown excuse is wearing thin now. Most people are back at work! Terrible.\n#HSBC up to your old fraudulent tricks again. Ironic that just yesterday I mention it and I receive what was a LTD business statement now in a Sole Trader account so you can come for money directly. Disgusting. Limited liability is limited liability and your choice to change that is FRAUD. anyone reading this avoid HSBC like the plague. They are disgusting greedy fraudulent pigs\nHSBC just closed it’s Birmingham Sheldon Branch in which I got the account.... HSBC needs to stop ✋ branch openings scams. Many business owners opened account due to new branches, but now they transferred it to to Solihull Branch which is far away from Sheldon.\nFor more protection against fraud, don't use HSBCs online banking and don't trust their incompetent fraud department that blocks your transactions but allows fraudulent transactions and does nothing because they expect you to know all about it\nI’ve been offered a business overdraft which I do not want. Have been on hold for over an hour and slowly giving up hope of speaking to anyone. There’s no way of knowing whether I’m next in the queue or have 100’s of people in front of me. All I want to do is reject the overdraft as I know HSBC will charge me for this!!! Really bad show\nIt is a scam what HSBC is doing to their staff's pensions! #fightforfairness\nNever had a problem with HSBC been wirh them since they were Midland Bank\n\"I applied for a bounce back loan in June still waiting now !!!!

Someone was using my card and you help me thorough the process of stopping it immediately! You were friendly and efficient! I will always bank HSBC\nScamming lol? Hsbc are the biggest scammers ever, have held my account and all by funds for a ‘review’ still no update and no funds! Business is fully down the drain now with a lot of debt to be cleared which were meant to be done through the funds that hsbc have held! Complaints made and no outcomes . Biggest scammers ever. Suffering mental depression because of this so called bank!\nDear  HSBC,  could  someone  from  the  “very  responsive” to messages  please  respond to  the  messages   have  been  sending  for  tye the past twenty  minutes?   I  can’t  phone  you  as  I  don’t have  phone  banking  set  Up,I  can’t access  my account  and i I cannot get  any  help/support  from  you.  Is  anyone  there?\nYep and HSBC doing very little to help solve this.  What is your fraud line number and how quick to you respond?\nHSBC my wife tried to log on to business banking as usual on Sunday but it was immediately rejected saying that there were too many failed attempts. She followed the process including printing a form, completing it, taking a photo and uploading it. She has not heard from you. So this afternoon she called the main HSBC number for help. After 60 minutes of being on hold she ended the call. She then called the number that was on the form, despite being continually informed that she was in a priority queue, after 90 minutes of being on hold, she ended the call. That is two and half hours of lost time. We have never experienced such a poor service from any organisation before. What do you suggest?\nOur so called HSBC gold plated pension after clawback is not worth a brass tack!\nI don't need HSBC to tell me how to budget thank you, although I have had many financial reviews with HSBC.  Pity their own Financial Planning Managers  never mentioned HSBC would keep 22% of my small company pension for themselves when I reach State Pension age. I am a loyal employee with 43 years' service and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known. Shame on you HSBC. Do the right thing and get rid of this unfair out if date practice like the others have, CLAWBACK has no place in this modern world.\nPerhaps i would not have to look for loose change around my sofa, if HSBC stopped taking 20% of my bank pension \nSo we are being taught to budget by HSBC. How ironic. Their employees budget carefully for retirement only to find that at state pension age HSBC claw money back from their pensioners who then have to budget again because they have less money. HSBC think that it is acceptable because it was ‘clearly communicated’ when we all joined the bank many years ago. Funny that they won’t provide definitive proof of this as these pensioners only found about this ‘state deduction’ as HSBC call it as it started affecting some many years later and after many years of loyal service. Look to your business morals HSBC as other companies did many years ago and reverse this state deduction. #fightingforfairness\nShame we didn’t have this advice over 40 years ago and known we were going to have to search down our sofas as Midland Bank/HSBC Staff Pension scheme was going to be “Clawed” back off us. I’m certain had loyal staff known this, or been advised of this from the beginning we would have changed our career paths, I know I would have. It’s a disgrace! \nThought I had budgeted until HSBC unfairly discriminated against me for starting my career in a particular time frame.  Shame on you Midland Bank /HSBC - only 50% of pension for the lowest paid staff, 30% clawed back by the bank and 20% tax. Doesn't apply to the highest paid though. What a surprise. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk for details and case studies.\nHSBC I tell you what we are tired of, the bank trying to portray itself as the best at this, the best at that, and still ripping off it's pensioners by taking part of their state pension.  You say it was \"part of the scheme and clearly communicated\". Hogwash !!  Many ex staff won't get a full state pension anyway because you contracted us all out but conveniently forgot to say that means you will get a reduced state pension.  The only thing you are best at is dumping on your staff from a great height, you'd win awards for that.\nI have moved home from living abroad and need to access my recent transactions and then close my hsbc uk bank account eventually. I am locked out of my hsbc app due to not having a security key and not having the same phone number or address in which originally opened my bank account and therefore cannot access my account!!! Everytime I try to call the number on your website or message you facebook it says your centre is closed!!!!!!\nManaging our budgets is an interesting concept from HSBC. My wife and I have 60 years employment with them combined and were never advised of clawback ... or 'state deduction' as they did refer to it so we all thought it was the government deducting not them. Yet they claim clear and consistent communication yet can provide no proof. Even their trust company and later pfs advisors never mentioned it. Budgeting advise Ha Ha. My wife and I lose a considerable part of our pensions at 66/67.\n\"HSBC there are scam emails going about requesting details or the account will be closed \nI know this is a scam as I’m not a customer \"\nHey HSBC how much of our pension money have you stuffed down your dirty sofa? Shameful.\nInteresting advertisement. I have had many financial reviews with HSBC.  Pity their own Financial Advisors never mentioned HSBC would keep a chunk of my relatively small company pension for themselves when I reached State Pension age. I was a loyal employee for almost 40 years and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known.\nShame on you HSBC, I thought I had budgeted for my retirement, only to find out I was 'losing' £125 a month from my small pension, I'm lucky enough to have a husband with a pension as I'm pretty sure I couldn't manage without him and our joint pensions, really feel for anyone on their own trying to manage. Shame on you HSBC!!!!!\nThought I did budget for my retirement until I found out HSBC will clawbank some of my staff pension. Shame on you HSBC we were told how  great our pensions were and it was all part of our package/salaries.\nWhen is what HSBC termed state deduction (which staff presumed was the reduced pension we also suffer because we were contracted out for NI) not actually a state deduction?  It’s when HSBC clawback 23% of my pension and unbelievably call it state deduction. I’ve now got 2 deductions. The real state deduction which affects my state pension and the unexpected STATE DEDUCTION which is actually HSBC robbing my already meagre bank pension and NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STATE. The biggest mistake of my life was to think HSBC was a reputable  employer. It’s a shameful company that does not practise what it preaches.\nHSBC you should be ashamed of yourselves! We were all told what a brilliant pension we were agoing to get. But in reality it was all a sham! You were actually going to use the state pension to subsidise your own scheme! ie clawback the equivalent of the state pension from your hard working ex staff when they reach state pension age! Mainly effecting the lowest paid and predominantly women. Shame on you!\nWould be able to manage my own future finances better if HSBC didn't clawback a large chunk of my pension when I reach 67, not something that was ever discussed with me.\nHsbc help your own retired staff budget by not clawing back their hard earned pensions #dotherighthing\nThis bank is terrible - been on hold since yesterday with an issue with commercial credit card - your fees go up your service goes down ... does anyone still work for HSBC ! or are you all out on jollies cycling !!\n\"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n\nGot through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes.

They went into their local branch for some help and advice only to be told there was on one who could help them! Than went back to try and sort out online banking only to be told to go home and do it them selves. Their both in their 70s and are in no way stupid but they are old fashioned and wanted face to face help. To set up online banking you need a telephone security code which they don’t have and we’re not told they needed in branch. When my dad mentioned about moving banks the assistant just said good luck with that!!\nYou have all these adverts saying how your there to help in different ways to suit customers needs !!! \"\nIt’s rare I complain but feel frustrated. I’ve been to my local HSBC branch in Meadowhall only to find that now they are closed on a Saturday! Most people who are working can’t get to branch during the reduced hours on a Monday to Friday. Saturday is the only day I can get to pay in cash. It wouldn’t be so bad if there was a paying in machine outside the branch but there isn’t! How about close one day in the week and open on a Saturday to offer a service to working people.\n\"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n\nGot through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!\n\nHSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.\n\nTIME FOR THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMEN!\"\nI know what I won’t be doing, is logging on to my accounts as HSBC make it impossible for me to do so!! What a joke of a company\nHSBC your customer service is an absolute shambles. I have been waiting over 10 weeks for a response and still nothing. What a joke\nHSBC's treatment of their business customers is abolutley shocking, I have been with the bank for 6 and half years running a small but profitable limited company, all of a sudden my accounts are all frozen, after spending a full day on hold nobody would tell me why, 5 days later I receive a letter saying the account is going to be shut down, no explanation as to why and I can't even get in touch with anyone to find out what is going on. This treatment is absolutley disgusting, they have crippled my business for no good reason. I run a small online company and can think of no reason why my account should be closed down. I would advise anyone thinking of opening an account with HSBC to think twice before they do, a simple search online will highlight the fact that I am not the only one who has had their business account closed without warning, HSBC have closed down hundreds of business accounts in the UK without warning or explanation, sort it out HSBC \nIf anyone want free music..but don't have a radio..call HSBC you get two hours of free music while you wait for someone to answer. 🤷🏻‍♂️  wish I had never gone with this bank.\nI'm absolutely disgusted with HSBC's customer service. I spent nearly an hour yesterday on the phone trying to make an appointment with the branch for my son to open a student account. We are both existing customers. I have been with HSBC for over 30 years. We were told that there are no branch appointments at the moment due to Covid, but we simply had to take I'd, proof of student status into the branch and we would be able to open one from there. We went into the branch today to be turned away and told to open the account online and that they could not help us in the branch...very unhelpful and certainly not what I've come to expect from HSBC... we will be taking our business elsewhere in the future.\n\"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n\nGot through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes.

My parents, in their late 70s, have recently been a victim of fraud, having thousands that they cannot afford taken out of their account. They went to a branch, only to be told they would have to call. They have called 3 times this week, spent a total of 8 hours on the phone, only to be cut off each time. I’m assuming you clearly don’t care about your customers, even if they are elderly and vulnerable \nHSBC seem to be offering fake help too. #bankingfraud #bankingscam\nIs there any change from UK   HSBC To South Africa Telegraphic transfer currency\nTogether against fraud? HSBC allows it and then does nothing to rectify it!

How about the one concerning a female branch clerk who has given 40 years of her life to the bank, some part-time and some full-time, who retires on a pension of £15k a year, only to find the bank claw back 30% of that when she hits State Pension Age - compared to a senior male manager who retires on £150k a year but inly has 2% a year clawed back from his huge pension.

It doesn’t matter what you do to help warn people about the very real risk of fraudsters, there will always be people that chose to disregard this important message and instead voice their views on their personal views and frustrations about HSBC.  \nSo far I have wasted best part of four hours of my life trying to get through to business support just to order a new security device. You are truly and utterly crap!\nI am suspicious of you not picking up your mortgage overpayment phone line to keep charging me your crazy interest rates!! 15 minutes waiting and counting! You are supposed to be a major bank you can do better than that!\nHsbc are terrible with fraud, they have sent me 3 cards and still letting the same fraudulent transaction go through every month, they are a complete joke would highly recommend using a different bank, the customer service level its appalling telling me I have to keep calling them back, the phone line they have breaks up every 5 seconds, joke of a bank that needs to get with the times\nIs anyone going to bother to reply to me!! You have refunded the WRONG credit card after waiting over 14 weeks! Will someone please refund the correct credit card and get back to me with how long it will take until the money will be back into my account. You are the WORST bank going and have done nothing to help me. I am not wasting anymore hours trying to call you when you never call me back as promised! Ridiculous! I expect a response TODAY!\ntrying to open childs account online as we already hold an account with HSBC. The system wont let you. get to the first page and put inmy childs details and then cant get any further. just blank screen. this happens on a tablet, home Pc and work pc all the same problem. Please advise when this will be fixed. \nYour business needs to be regulated.  You are also a f up mess with Safeguard, it is one of the most stressful things anyone can go through with your bank.  We have moved our entire banking to Starling bank.  Had enough of you HSBC, we will also refuse to pay back the Government backed loan, that is your problem, we refuse to give you any of that back due to the stress and chaos of dealing with your business.  So thank you for the free Government backed loan, that is now your proble. Perhaps instead of dictating to your customers with your terribly executed Safeguard, perhaps you might want to work on making your services more user-friendly.  Also can you please stop blaming Covid for you not answering your phones.  You have always been slow with answering your phones, so why the lies?.  You are a terrible bank, a relic of a past that is going to catch up with you soon.  \nI have called you twice now within the last 30mins trying to sort a query on an urgent payment I've made and twice you've cut me off. This last time I asked to be called bk and gave my number if this happened and you've not\nI've just had text saying I added payee I don't even bank with you\nVery nice of you to care so much. What a shame your customer service is so useless. Always passing the buck and always refering you back to the telephone rather than on line chat. Disgusting attitude to genuine concerns. Still waiting for a letter sent 3 weeks ago and reminded you but STILL no letter or answer fro. Customer. care. You have even paid money into my account yet wont tell me why it break down the details. So  So shoddy and uncaring\nHi I need some assistance please I've sent a direct message can someone please help me\nshocking service all round from these clowns, impossible to get hold of .\nThey card take long to be opne\nHSBC telephone banking service indian call centre staff as much help as a pea nut going to the financial ombudsman service.\nI literally just got a text message from someone claiming to be you guys.\nTry replying to your business customers\nAmateurs at their best!!\nBiggest fraudsters are HSBC, absolute nightmare to deal with, can't wait to leave, and even that's been fraught with hassle!!\ni have been on hold for 1hr 45 mins and need to speak to somebody\nYou are seriously the worst bank when it comes to customer service!! Can someone contact me ASAP?\nLocked out of internet banking and the only way to unlock it is to call you on a number that is incredibly busy! Move with the times and have more options.\n\"Be overly suspicious. Block your customers transaction as fraudulent (it wasn’t) and then hold the money in pending for days. Completely ignore the customer and hang up on them. Or simply just keep transferring and putting them customer on hold.\n\nMaybe if you think a transaction is fraudulent you could talk to the customer rather than leave it up to the customer to sort out themselves afterwards?\"\nYou were freezing my account because of all the fraud that was done on there and the lady at the bank said it would be put on hold and that I'd have to go into the bank to withdrawal money until my photo ID is sorted and I've just checked my online banking and 2 payments made online have come out. I was told my card would no longer be able to be used online.  All my money for my son's Xmas and birthday all gone!! I can't speak to anyone over the telephone because the automated service doesn't recognise my birthday and because that doesn't work no advisors will speak to me because I've failed security. Furious right now.\n⚠️ They’re sending cheques for £25 now pretending to be HSBC. I received one yesterday, I put it in my profile this morning asking people to share to make others aware.  😞 \nAbsolutely no manners and not able to secure a bank account from fraud absolutely disgraceful 😡😡 going to FCA's\n\"I'm still in shock that i cannot see my online credit card transactions, I have to download as a CSV month by month!\nPlease fix this or i'll leave...\"\nSent you a few IM's as per instructions from HSBC Premier.   Would appreciate it if you could read and respond.\nyou have taken away the savers card as the card was eaten by the cash machine, we had no notification that this service was ending and now have no access to money and cant buy food or pay bills, your customer service is non existant, cant get through on the phone lines, no live chat and cant get an appointment in any branch of HSBC, you have kept savings and we cant get them now.  Disgusting service from HSBC I will be contacting the CEO\nYou are lucky to have your credit card< I have been waiting for 5 months now on my approved credit card, and there is NO one you can phone and talk to, after an hour on the phone they just put you through to another department and you wait another hour ... oh yes I forgot to mention covid-19 is to blame, blame for all bad customer service.\nIs anybody reading the messages on your messaging service, as im still waiting for an urgent reply.\nI support a community group who have been trying to get their account verified  - local branch staff in Doncaster are useless, online chat are useless, phoning for hours at a time and not getting anywhere.  The group are missing out on £1000's of funding, they were affected by the floods in Doncaster in 2019 and are still trying to build their community, money from funding pots will go a long way to help but they cannot apply because they haven't got their account sorted!!!!\nNo reply to my complaint ombudsman here I come\nThe world's most useless bank\nIt’s will be better for HSBC not to look 👀 at new customers rather then searching for old customers who got account 💰 with HSBC and provide them proper service. Due to COVID-19 people are not able to send money to some body\\company online.\nShittest bank ever.\nYes, we know you are corrupt and fraudsters HSBC, thank you for informing us.\nNever known a bank to take forever to send bank transfers within the uk. Bank transfers should be instant but no i have to wait all day, i cant go shopping to.get my kids food because i sent money from my hsbc to another account and its not been recieved yet its a joke! 🤬\n\"Have tried to ring twice today and after waiting for over twenty minutes, both times the line has gone silent but still connected.\n\nI was Just trying to get a telephone banking number sorted which is needed in order to register/use the app to activate a card.\n\nIt has to be the worst system in order to use an app/register a card I have ever come across.\n\nAnyway I will never now use the card or activate it, wasted to much time already trying to sort it out, so can HSBC tell me how long before the/an inactive account is closed? \"\nI have been listening to hold music for business banking for 1hr 59 minutes. I assume your staff have all switched off their phones . #shambles\nI have a community bank account  that has had fraudulent activity on. I have tried every day this week to contact you. You are NOT answering your calls.  Today’s was 2 hours 8 minutes and then I hung up. Yesterday’s was 56 minutes then you cancelled the connection. I am desperate for help. Another bank dealt with the same problem in two 20 minute phone calls. What can I do ....\nBit like BBLS. Applied for it back in may, rang 4 times to chase it, nothing. Cheers for the help after 10 years working for the bank and 25 years a customer \nScam...? Really your bank is a Scam I have had money taken out of my account numerous times this last year unauthorised, and I get told that it can’t be refunded back into my account, this is ridiculous now beyond a joke every time I cancel and block my card then it happens again. Been with you guys 20+ years but you do nothing about this not even return my money that’s been taken... you should be ashamed of yourselves!!!\nits getting harder to know who you are talking to at hsbc not able get through on phones, call backs are from overseas but say they are in uk ,scam ? dont know , sort yourselves out please. still on phone when i could be working.\nAppalling Customer Services and systems\ncould not agree more - useless effers can't even answer the phone 53 minutes and waiting. Absolutely unacceptable\nHsbc how about you answer this question, I was furloughed in the first lock down so you kindly deferred my loan, the 3 month period finished so I had to start paying it again using my overdraft to cover the payments which I bank with you so you can see this, I didn't realise I could I of extended my defferal, so I applied only to be told no can't do that cause I've been paying my payments (note they are being payed with my overdraft which you can see as I bank with you), now lock down mk2 so guess what I try again only to be told the same thing, o thank you very much very understanding, well guess what the over 20 years of banking with you and my sons trust fund will be leaving your bank and likely going nationwide, but don't worry cause you will pay new customers £125 to come to you but wont help and existing loyal customer\nGave up after an hour. A complaint will be coming your way but not by telephone. You are utterly useless.\nPLEASE STOP YOUR PHONE BANKING SERVICE - ITS USELESS- alSO CREDIT CARD SECURITY SYSTEM IS JUST NOT WORKING- IT CREATE MORE ISSUE-\nYour bank is a joke. Take debit cards away from accounts and then you can't get your OWN money out. Will be taking this further\nScam is having your account blocked depsite giving you a travel notification then holding for the fraud department for 27 mins and getting cut off. I am in Australia and can't hold for that long for nothing as it is costing a fortune to call overseas. Not good enough as you have now left me with no access to my money. How am I supposed to live without money\nCould someone tell the point of this feed if HSBC are not there for customers when they need them ?\nCan't login into the app. Go to laptop to reset passwords. Answer the two security questions correctly then it says generate a new code... ON THE APP. So it's a circular problem. All I want for Christmas is a new bank!!!!\nHSBC is one of the worst bank in the UK. I have a business account with you, there was a fraud transaction on my account, the card was blocked and call back was promised on weekend. No one called me yet. I keep calling the bank since yesterday morning, I am on the phone for 50+ minutes but no asnwer. It is absolutely unacceptable. Your customer service is huge zero. 😡\nHSBC pretend to be good, but they do not care one sec for their customers. Simply no customer service to find at all\nYour fraud department is exactly that...a fraud!\nStill waiting for the fraud department to call me back after 4 days of waiting!\nCan you get that useless automated piece of crap voice recognition sorted. It's useless\nTrying to contact HSBC Business, been on hold for over an hour...  why do we pay them to have our money??\nHSBC has for no reason just blocked me from my business account, fighting to save 200 jobs, but what do they care. The account has always been in credit, but what do they care...  If covid does not get us HSBC will...  what awful people...\n\"Worst service: two staff members that don’t have a clue about how to find a solution to a problem:\n\nStaff ID numbers 45014422 and 43899840 \n\"\nCalling you since July to solve my online security settings...and still not working. It's a joke. Definitely changing this bank asap\nAbsolutely fuming. Been sat on hold for almost 3 hours on your telephone lines just to be able to change my withdrawal limit. I will be registering a complaint and withdrawing my money forthwith.\nWhy r u blocking me from sending a instant payment to another bank account of mine until tomorrow saying transactions after 6pm r processed next day what a joke and before u say its standard with all accounts I was able to receive money from someone else after 6pm instantly into my account just u blocking my payments. What a bloody joke\n\"HSBC   \nYou did this to my Son.  Here is his letter to you.  \n\nDear HSBC, I am going to bank these cheques you have sent to buy my kids Christmas presents. \nHowever do not take this as my acceptance of your negligence when you were supposed to be dealing with this over 7 years ago.\nBack then I was,\nILL (just had a mild stroke)\nWas made redundant.\nLiving on a shoe string,\nLost my car, nearly lost my house. I ended up renting out my house and living with my mom in Devon and what did you do absolutely nothing and in fact you did worse you shut down all my accounts because I was awarded the PPI you had denied owing me after 2/3 years of fighting you. \nDo you no what it is like having bailiffs knocking at your door for something that wasn't your fault. \nThen 7 years later now I'm back on my feet you send me this guilt letter. \nHow about you go into my credit file and readjust everything that you did and give me back 3 years of my life. Your bank disgusts me .\"\n\"Business banking is bloody terrible. Cant pay staff or suppliers as I cant access my online banking..... spoken to them 5 times in last 1.5 days and still not resolved.\nCall centre will cut you off if approaching end of their shift after holding for an hour and twenty minutes\"\nWHY HAVE U PUT MY BANK ACC UNDER REVIEW????\nWell done I shall tell u because of your terrible banking issues and total lies from your staff u left my disabled son wit no medicine all weekend now shocked with all lies and errors. Well done hope your all happy now I have to wait till Monday to try to sort again !! What a joke bank. Over 10 h on phone last few days and lied to and cheated and u took money from my 78 year old father too for no reason, no one even got back to me after promise too! Wow just wow I shall continue untill u sort this out letter to ombudsman too and papers n mp. I even tryed to contact through here still no response ectjoke this is man!\n\"Had my card declined for security reasons, but can’t get through on the chat or phloneline, instead just sat on hold for hours on end!!! \nGreat, when it’s the only card you have.😤🤬\"\nWhat a ridiculous bank HSBC is.  My husband tried to pay in some cash for my daughter, who is a key worker and was hard at work in the pharmacy.  The bank refused to take the cash because he is not the account holder & he does not have an HSBC account himself.  Unbelievable.\nIs there any way to remove some of your over the top security requests? I just want to check my balance on the app - having to enter multiple codes is completely ridiculous.\nBeen on the phone almost 4 hours to report fraud! Can’t believe no one has answered! I will be changing all my accounts to Halifax! At least they answer urgent calls! 😡\nWished they spent more time answering phones than posting adverts as I've been on hold for hours on end as they say to call them regarding fraud on my account when I get through can't understand lady on the other end then they put phone down and another hour wasted on hold!!!!!\nHave been on hold to HSBC since 10.00 am this morning.  Call cuts out after 4 hours of waiting so this is the third attempt today. Is anybody there ?\nI bank with Santander, but opened a basic account as an executor account with HSBC at the branch where my dad banked. I have a secure key to log on, but every time I try to pay beneficiary's they stop the payment and suspend the account. I did talk with them over the phone, explained everything AND GUESS WHAT THEY SUSPENDED THE ACCOUNT AGAIN! Infuriating...this time told to go to the branch, which of course is closed. Would never had had this problem if I had put the money in my Santander account.\nbeen on the phone over an hour trying to get through and now you have cut me off so i am going to withdraw all money from account and go to a bank that cares about its customers\n\"What’s the point.\nIt’ll be closed within 5 years.\nHSBC is far too busy distancing itself from its customers. Pushing them away ... \"\n\"Shame there's nobody in there to answer phone calls!\n3 hours now trying to get through to anybody\"\nMay I suggest that until you can operate your business contact center properly (or at all) you concentrate on the core business in hand.....................\nWOW I'm so glad they can employ somebody to turn some lights on......... How about answering your phones? Or keeping you Online Chat actually online? Or answering e-mails? 45 minutes plus ever time you phone before anybody thinks about answering your call. And they take money out of your account before checking you still require the service that are charging you for. BUT it's all Covid's fault!!!! Muppets using lame excuses...\nYou can light up buildings and honour all sorts of groups, other than your own staff pensioners. Some State Pension Integration might be fair but your clawback isn't. Take back only 2% from the highest paid but 30% from the lowest! Typical greed from the senior management. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk\n@hsbc_uk I have had the worst banking experience of my life. After 16 years of banking with you, I will be closing all of my accounts on Monday. The way I’ve been treated by you is disgusting. I needed to transfer some money urgently and I’ve been made to wait till I can go into a branch on Monday. Why am I made to go into a branch in the middle of a pandemic. Why can’t you be diligent enough to do your checks online. I am so disappointed with your services. You have no issues taking my money but when it comes to taking it back from you, it becomes a war. People need to avoid this bank. I will be posting on all social media platforms. Disgusting behaviour! \nTried all yesterday to speak to your Business Banking agents, kept on phone, absolutely ridiculous, why can you not open up like Santander on Saturdays, HSBC Bishops Stortford closed.  No phone service for business customers when they most need it.  Now considering taking all my accounts away both personal and business.\n\"Worst service: two staff members that don’t have a clue about how to find a solution to a problem:\n\nStaff ID numbers 45014422 and 43899840 \n\"\nOh yes Lucy-Anne that is HSBC on it's best for you. I have never ever in my life seen bad service like they do it.\nStop bloodily virtue signalling and do something to help your customers FOR ONCE\nWow, looking at all of the dissatisfied customers in the below comments, I'm guessing that the original post didn't go the way they hoped. I for one wouldn't want to open an account with them.\nAlways nothing but problems HSBC I hope all these issues get solved but I also will make sure everyone knows that because of your mistakes even bank of Canada agree u have left a very sick boy at 10 with no medical care. This is serious guys still weeks of trying everything to sort my end and huge phone bills still no luck just lies! Guys this needs to stop hope your big boys at top all having nice weekend I am trying to keep my kid alive u jokes\nI'm surprised you allowed them to transfer their own money from their own accounts, you won't let me\nIs it possible you can answer telephones in less than 2hrs and actually help businesses that create your wealth ?\n\"Why no email address to contact you?

Mexico, Brazil... Biggest fraud in the UK is how HSBC treat 52,000 of their former Midland Bank staff pensioners. They  certainly didn't explain clawback and glibly told people they would get a 2/3 final salary pension. Lies! Now clawing back up to 30% from the lowest paid. Time to do the right thing HSBC and drop clawback. I doubt Ian Stuart, Noel Quinn or anybody in a senior post will ever read this and they certainly seem to only have their own best interests at heart. Interesting that the bank's pension trustees are contacting people to put themselves forward as a pension scheme trustee but have pointedly not contacted any of the clawback campaign committee.\nLondon and Birmingham are the best place for scam criminals all over UK.\n2 hours waiting to get through to you. You’ve left a old man with no food . You’ve stopped his card and he’s no money .\nYour fraud team are a joke, when you get the trauma of somebody managing to spend almost £2,000 from your account and desperatley trying to speak to somebody you can actually understand and that can actually understand what you are trying to tell them after 90 minutes is crazy.. Then when it all finally sinks in you don't want to know as I managed to get my money back from the company the transactions were made too myself, even though the company has an address and a phone number of the person that did it, neither you or the Police are interested.. Totally bizarre\nIronic that HSBC warning people about scams when they scam customers of 30 years plus with rip off interest rates on personal borrowing despite current interest rates being their lowest ever. Rip off bank.\n\"Worst service: two staff members that don’t have a clue about how to find a solution to a problem:\n\nStaff ID numbers 45014422 and 43899840 \n\"\nThis is good. I remember Midland School Banks from about 30 years ago. You could also have educated your staff about the clawback feature of their pensions, or at least the pensions of 52,000 of your staff. Clawing back up to 30% of the pension when SPA is reached. That is for the lowest paid; the highest paid may have only 2% clawed back! This affects women far worse than men and the lowest paid far worse than the higher paid. Unfair and immoral.

Whilst I was looking after the boys at the local High School, I mistakenly thought that HSBC had my back and were taking care of me.\nIt would have been in my interest if Clawback has been fully explained to myself not forgetting 52000 others!\nSo here's the thing HSBC, whilst I was taking care of our customers, just exactly what were you doing for me. Well, let be remind you. You contracted me out of the second state pension. True, you saved me circa £6 per week, but now it is costing me £40 per week in retirement. Also somewhere along the way you might just have made sure that I was fully aware that my 2/3rd final salary pension included my state pension.\"\nHSBC is an international bank so call centres can be based anywhere...... stay safe Philippine’s wishing everyone and their families well\nBeen on hold for 90 minutes and my calls have been cut off TWICE but useless colleagues manning these calls.

They last checked this account just 10 months ago. Apparently, there was a suspicious payment to 'SA Glasgow' which they wanted to investigate in regard to potential money laundering. I had to inform this idiot that 'SA Glasgow' is in fact 'HMRC Self Assessment', who are in Glasgow. It is Her Majesty's government, for goodness sake. This is just laughably incompetent. So instead of presenting yourself, HSBC, as caring citizens supporting Children in Need, how about ceasing to harass and intimidate people trying to support their disabled relatives for no reason whatsoever. \n\"I post cats, and fitness related posts 👌😉\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CHVYnurnlNt\"\nYour service is terrible I've been on hold for a total of 3 hours so far today just to reset my telephone password...\n\"the new different\"? This use of an adjective as a noun is the latest newspeke type nonsense used as PR/spin.There is nothing 'different' about HSBC apart from they are one of the worst banks for ethical investments.Just look into their actions since the 2008 meltdown.Adverts NEVER mention that do they? Same old same old............\nHow can I speak to someone please. I've spent 13.5 hours on hold over 3 days with no answer.\nDoes the new different include treating your former Midland Bank staff fairly? 52,000 still suffering clawback, which, despite your claims, was not clearly and consistently communicated. Junior clerks with pensions of less than £10,000 having 30% of this pension clawed back, whilst only 2% clawed back from the highest paid. Unfair. Immoral. Yet legal. Time to do the right thing and actually apply your group standards. Remove clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk\nI would love to donate again this year. Unfortunately though HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance.

I'm trying to remortgage to save money, I can't do it online for some reason, so have to wait for someone to answer the phone. While waiting I've had a shower and had lunch but need to go back to work, so I really can't stay on hold much longer. Thank you. \nHi HSBC when you apply online for a mortgage holiday extension do you receive some sort of email confirming receipt of your application? I’m only asking as I’ve received nothing and wanted to make sure that my application has been received.\nCan someone, anyone just answer the phone.

I know this is a pointless post but just wanted to say they are certainly not all sweetness and light as they are trying to make out\nReading these comments doesn’t make me feel quite so bad that I only waited 30 minutes on hold before getting cut off. HSBC, I’m sure you are experiencing high call volumes but why send out an email asking someone to call when you have their mobile phone number on record and it would be easier for you to call them? My mortgage payment got reversed last month due to insufficient funds and I’d spoken to an HSBC adviser, shortly afterwards, who arranged with me to take the payment on the 3rd of this month, 7 days before the next mortgage direct debit goes out. Guess what, it never happened so I suppose it’s my fault and that’s why they want me to get in touch with them. HSBC, if you actually get to read this, you can call or email me but I’m not listening to a message that sounds like a war time speech and then echo chamber music for another 30 minutes to get cut off again. I tried for 20 minutes this morning and 30 minutes just now but that’s it! Find a good alternative way of contacting me about this issue and I’ll be more than happy to discuss it with a real person. Have a nice day 🙂\nThey’re not fit for purpose. Get rid of them\nWell done Neil, you’ve done brilliantly.  Raising so much for Children In Need, awesome 👏 xx\nAbsolutely Amazing Neil.

As a business customer I am sick to the back teeth of being made to queue on the phone for hours to sort HSBC ISSUES and forced to speak to people who don’t have English as their first languages, making the whole experience even more painful.

Maybe this means that there will BE some customer-facing colleagues. For now it doesn't seem to be the case. 4 hours on the phone with your 'customer service' and no one picked up. My card dispute is 5 months old now, soon I'll give it a name and celebrate its first birthday. Can't wait to leave HSBC!\nHSBC currently due to lockdown to wait and reach the operators from abroad is expensive. So, it would be beneficial if we can arrange a direct call with the operator and then catch up.
