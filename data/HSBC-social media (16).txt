@Ebbrell67 gotta love HSBC, the worlds listening bank. I was stood outside their HQ in Hong Kong getting robbed at gunpoint by a meth crazed Mamasan telling them on the phone I was being robbed and they were forcing me to get cash out. Only overseas transaction they've ever approved.
@arthyvenkatesh @HSBC_IN Yes coz they are masters of milking money even you have crisis around. An art of making money on times of crisis is epitomised by @HSBC_IN
@HSBC_IN RBI rolled down rates - but when you contact HSBC - it asks you for rate change charges!!! We want to pay our EMIs without default - but HSBC wants us to pay â€œrate change chargesâ€ for something which govt has passed on!! Good going HSBC for your arm twisting tactics..

@HSBC_US Stop blaming your terrible service on #Covid_19. You even reduced your call center hours. Why don't you update your outdated callcenter with remote agents who can work from home? For a month I have been trying to resolve an issue. Horribly frustrating #service service.
@Bounce_BackLoan Received my second ecosign this morning (after being a 000 HSBC'er yesterday) However e mail states "After you sign all parties will receive a final PDF copy by email." No e mails received, no PDF, so another call to make !ðŸ˜¤
@Bounce_BackLoan @HMRCgovuk @BritishBBank So there is a god out there I have been payed from Hsbc just now ,and it was paid into my personal account but this may be because I am a first direct customer
@Barclays I will be applying through @HSBC later. Barclays are a shambles of a bank,businesses will be going under before you pull the finger out and help them!Maybe spend less on advertising/PR and put it into your crap system thatâ€™s always broken!Government should be getting involved

@HSBC_UK Just wanted to find out if there are any fees for receiving a Global Transfer into my HSBC UK account? Sender is with HSBC Hong Kong.
@santanderukhelp I moved my account from HSBC to Santander late last year and my DDs/monthly credits/SOs transferred automatically. If someone makes a payment into my closed HSBC account now, will it automatically forward to my Santander account?
@Bounce_BackLoan Called HSBC again just now, got through immediately - asked for a feeder account, took all my details, same as this morning, told me there was no timeframe. Bizarre how it didnâ€™t pop us having already been pushed through. Mustnâ€™t register for them.
@HSBC_UK why is it taking HEBC so long to process the Business bounce back loans, when other banks are processing and communicating so rapidly? Some within 48 hours? It's two weeks today!
@LetsRideNE @HSBC_UK @letsrideuk Wowww so good on ride keep it upðŸ’žðŸ’ž
@Bounce_BackLoan If a "few days" for a BBL is over two weeks and counting. I wonder what they define a long delay as? Perhaps a month or maybe a year? New marketing slogan "HSBC - redefining time for the self employed!"
@OldMackIsBack ...and to apply for the loan which whoever was the quickest. Starling account was opened, verified, loan applied for and deposited in the account quicker than HSBC could send me an email saying there were further steps to complete in their account opening process.
HSBC online savings account rates are a fraud. They lure you in with a high 1.7% rate and 6 month requirement else closing fees. Then a month later lower the rate to 1.3%! Whereâ€™s my class action lawsuit people? @NerdWallet @HSBC @lawyers4liberty
@coppermedia @segwaybude @Bounce_BackLoan @kirko1904 @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness I felt exited when I got mine on Thursday. Not so much now though.
@OldMackIsBack Depends on the bank. I hear Clydesdale are slow as hell. Tide are now accredited but are in the middle of raising funds to support the loans. HSBCâ€™s account opening process takes too long and is too bureaucratic. I decided to open an account with Starling and HSBC...

@santanderukhelp my son is autistic and got scammed into transferring money into a fraud account. But because he authorized it thinking it was ok Santander wonâ€™t help him recover the money or even offer him compensation. Iâ€™m with Hsbc and this has happened to me, I got my money
"@dskyward Hi there, the charges for payments send in to a UK HSBC account would be as below -
 
 Non-sterling payments of the currency equivalent of Â£100 and over = Â£8 
 Each sterling payment of Â£100 and over = Â£6
 
 Hope it answers your question ðŸ™‚ ^Sam"
Money heist got me thinkin i can take HSBC, time to crack on with THE planðŸ’¸
@HSBC_UK Hi - thanks for getting back to me. I did try it on my computer as well and it was very slow, but I'll see how it goes. Thanks again.
"@balajis mentioned treasury volatility for two reasons:
 
 1. u.s. banks chose to pile into treasury positions in the second half of 2019
 
 2. european financials have been trading at anemic price:book ratios going INTO this crisis 
 
 think names like HSBC are going to be in deep trouble."
So @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC we are over 2 weeks now and not a single communication from you. Disgraceful considering these loans are for the smallest businesses in immediate need. https://t.co/m1qZnSsr0z
in my experience itâ€™s not too difficult to get an assessment (a stranger asking u very sensitive questions in a tone not far from that of HSBC customer service going through security questions) but anything after that is stressful enough to drive even the most lucid to deliration
@HSBC_UK you advised me I needed to call you regarding possible fraud on my account. I called and was placed on hold for over an hour and ten minutes... then cut off before speaking to the team!! I know youâ€™re busy but thatâ€™s terrible. Whatâ€™s going on with my account #Fraud #HSBC
"UK companies have cut or deferred Â£30bn in dividend payments to shore up their balance sheets to weather the financial impact of the coronavirus crisis.
 
 HSBC and BT among firms to make largest reductions to weather pandemic, data shows.

@HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK Why are you not making sure your existing customers are prioritised in the BBL. Iâ€™ve been waiting over 2 weeks and not a thing but seen non-existing customised receive there BBL! I donâ€™t understand how youâ€™ve let this happen?
@HSBC_IN the only way to read your website, is in a pukka british accent. retrieved pronunciation. The Queen's English. Entire India is ok with "Login", but you pretentious lot has to call it "Log On". Keep carrying on, old chaps.

@RoutineGroup @HSBCUKBusiness Have you heard anything till now? I did the same. Applied on 4 May and no ack then re-applied last Thu and received email BUT since then nothing. Several phone calls, on hold, very stressed as my CBILS was approved and then Hsbc called me to say I should apply for the bbls.

@DeclanBanfield1 @Manfrompind @Bounce_BackLoan We applied on may 5th. Got eco sign docs from @HSBC_UK on May 10th. Signed them on May 10th and 9 days later still waiting for the money drop.

I have absolutely no problem cancelling my Premiere Business banking to @HSBC, who I've recently had an incredible experience with. If customer service isn't important to @TDBank_US, I don't need to be a Premiere customer.
@lankylad9 Kindly forward it to - report.phishing@hsbc.com ^Sam

@HSBC_UK Really frustrated, adding funds to existing mortgage with low ltv has taken ages, accepted offer now having to wait for searches?! Please help speed this up!
@Bounce_BackLoan Applied for HSBC feeder account on the 13th. Advised to wait 3-5 days for email with account details. Nothing mentioned about having further phone conversation to actually apply. I've read all the comments about these 'mystery accs' ðŸ˜‚
I opened an @hsbc online savings account after an ad stating the APY would be 1.8%. In 3 weeks, my APY was changed twice, and now is at 1.3%. I get variable rates, but that is a dramatic difference. Tell me how that isn't false advertising.

@ukManojLad Hi Manoj, we have received thousands of applications from HSBC and non HSBC customers for bounce back loans and working through them as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience and understanding while we try to get back to you as soon as possible. ^Sam
Also @HSBC_UK.........why is it soooooo difficult to just get some average customer service from you guys??? Iâ€™d take average at the moment, this is soooo frustrating. Whereâ€™s the personal touch? Your staff are a joke ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸
