HSBC already suffered some reputational damage by closing the account of an activist on dubious â€œmoney launderingâ€ claims and recently canceling their dividend. Not unreasonable to think theyâ€™d like to sit this one out (and avoid create a precedent, too)

@HSBC_UK Hello, your smartphone app allows me to transfer a maximum of Â£10k. I need to make a one-off larger payment. What are my options please?
@ting_tong22 My emails are being ignored by HSBC CEOs and other people with authorisation .. it's all bollocks .. I am more in debt now waiting for HSBC to pull their fingers out of their arses than I first started fed up of telling creditors I'll pay next week..

@Richhomer78 Hi Rich, to set up or reset a telephone security number you will need to visit a branch or by calling Telephone Banking 03457 404 404, they will be able to assist you and guide you to register for online banking. ^Claude
@ting_tong22 It's just for money laundering regulations .but if HSBC are doing hard checks they are breaching boundaries set by the government. They will screw over every business going but I think that is just to open the feeder account after that submit BBl application and wait for funds

@Bounce_BackLoan HSBC carried out two credit file checks on me for AML and voters ID , so YES they carry out credit file checks as they have to do KYC checks.
bounce back loans hsbc I have a 1 hour call back booked in for today to set up a feeder account, has anyone done this? What happens after this, Can I then finally apply for the BBL?
@Bounce_BackLoan Exactly hsbc will check ur credit file for fruad purposes and KYC. As most banks do when setting up any account with them.
@HSBC_UK any chance of my call being answered? Iâ€™ve been on hold for 1hr 45mins and counting!
@HSBC Hello ðŸ– I changed my name about 6 months ago and changed it with HSBC, I got a new debit card with my name on but not a new credit card. I don't know whether when ordering online with my cc whether to use my old name or not. Neither seems to work though! Please help!
