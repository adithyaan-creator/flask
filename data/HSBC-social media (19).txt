@HSBC_UK I have asked repeatedly for @HSBC_UK to confirm how long it can undertake an account review for and if there are any limits on how long it can freeze a customer's accounts for. Can you answer this please?
@HSBC_UK @olimorts46 @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK is clearly busy using this opportunity to gain new customers as opposed to supporting their existing ones !! Its been 3+ weeks since applied for BBLS after 10 years of banking with them !!!

@Bounce_BackLoan @chuxley4368 After you get the Account/Sort-Code, you need to Visit: https://t.co/7ykRiqo5Ru
If you get an HSBC feeder account sort code and account number you can then apply for a BBL, @chuxley4368 has manged to do that, not been paid yet, but if you reach that stage and get stuck give him a shout. He can tell you where to click on their website etc
@NorthernCrumble @Bounce_BackLoan Crikey! Its going to be a full on bender when/if. Hsbc let me have mine
@HSBC_US I requested that the 80 day countdown for some security device be removed since I don't have a security device to get the number they want but no one knows or sees anything. I haven't logged in my account in many months.
@ERCoachMedrano @CoachFore If it is HSBC &amp; it is, he probably played on offense or defense somewhere.
@HSBC_UK nearly 3 weeks since applying for the bbl! Iâ€™ve still not had a form to sign despite a bbl account popping up on my account but I cannot access it! I know you are busy but 3 weeks &amp; counting?... how do I get it checked incase an issue please

@Nick_Morey @HSBC_US Same here! They promoted 10 minute fast access but I still am unable to access my online account 6 months after. Customer service is "sorry" , yes it is - sorry and useless! I don't need apologies, I need access to my account without problems during this pandemic!
@Bounce_BackLoan WOAH! Just emailed HSBC and got a response back in 58 seconds!!!!
@HSBC_UK terrible customer service. A bank error has cost me over Â£1000. I called customer service to rectify the fault. Call answered after 1 hour and was then told to call a second number. Put on hold for 2 hours and then cut off without warning. Rubbish service.

@HSBC_IN My debit card is still not delivered and about this I spoke to you almost before a month ago.When can I expect it to be delivered?
Using CC &amp; have bank account from @HSBC_ID doing payment twice from @CIMBNiaga. The @HSBC_ID didn't receive the money. Very difficult contact the CS. Bad connection, one CS suggest to send proof of payment, other suggest to complaint to @CIMBNiaga. Shame on you @HSBC

just a selfish moan but when are we going to sort these Banks out trying to change primary user of Co. account at HSBC had to chase 4 times currently on 5th total waiting time 3hrs 57 mins and counting. And they say they value customers ? already cut of once today.

@Saintbarca @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness Barclays can now pay in cheques using online banking? Donâ€™t they offer same service
@HSBC_UK @XantheXenakis Don't hold your breath. Ten months locked out of accounts so far. HSBC won't even say how much longer they will freeze accounts for.
@oldstyledating_ @HSBC_UK I think you might be correct about loosing the application, I applied with HSBC and they sent me the forms to sign digitally 2 days later. Signed and in my account in under a week!! Try again
@Lab19Digital @ParkFare @HSBCUKBusiness Also 18 days since i signed, been completely blanked by HSBC.
@HSBC_UK Put your tea down and answer the question. How long can you freeze innocent customer's accounts for? You refuse to answer. Does anybody at HSBC care at all about their customers ? Or is this just marketing nonsense? How about real action rather than marketing straplines?
@HSBC_UAE Hello Karen, can I have some help with a payment please?
@HSBC_UK HSBC refuses to answer how long it can freeze an innocent customer's account. Because it doesn't want people to know that it does this. Ten months accounts have been frozen

@HSBC_UK All this money you spend on advertising. If you care about good PR how about answering the question I have asked you. Twitter can see you don't respond. Great PR HSBC!!!
@HSBC_UK How long can you freeze innocent customer's accounts for ? Please answer. Accounts have been frozen ten months and you are still refusing to give an answer. This is terrible customer service and very poor PR

@HSBC_UK Morning :) Last year I did some work in the UK and this year I got a cheque from HMRC. I was wondering if I can walk into any bankoffice and cash in on this cheque? If so what paperwork is needed? Or do I need a bankaccount to cash in on it? I live in Sweden
@HSBC_IN Thank you
@HSBC_UK @hsbc please respond. Why do you not respond to a simple question ??????
"@HSBCUKBusiness I applied for a Bounce Back Loan for my company on the morning that applications opened. No confirmation email, no reply from HSBC, no contact at all. 
 I have no idea what is going on - how do I find out? The service to date has been nil.
 Is there a human being I can speak to?"
@HSBC_UK truly awful, upsetting behaviour of your staff who have failed to provide a solution for a SHILEDED customer trying to transfer funds to complete flat sale to protect herself. Your actions are the lowest of the low. Scandalous. How do I complain?
