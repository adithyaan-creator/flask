@Justemm1 @Bounce_BackLoan @bounceybounce3 @beachbum84w @HSBC_UK @LloydsBank @StarlingBank Are you both with Lloyds too?
@MartinSLewis do you know anything about the HSBC BBL feeder accounts, I applied last Wednesday but havenâ€™t heard anything, I called HSBC today and after an hour on hold eventually someone told me that it would be 3-5 m days before someone contacts me, but Iâ€™m worried they wonâ€™t!
@BarclaysUK Why is it faster for us as a business to switch our entire business banking to @HSBC_UK and get the government backed bounce back loan from @HSBC_UK than to get it from you when we currently using you for business banking and have been for 7 years?

@bounceybounce3 @beachbum84w @HSBC_UK @LloydsBank @StarlingBank Payments have been forthcoming not sure about Sunday agreed on all other points. However re payments when they do come, well they just open the doors and windows and through it out the door I have seen 100's of people paid.
@beachbum84w @marcoseven5 @EmmaCla08473479 @HSBC_UK Last Monday
@beachbum84w @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBC_UK @LloydsBank @StarlingBank There are also a lot of pissed off @LloydsBank customers, myself included the grass is not greener, communication has been piss poor they have made no payouts over the weekend, no responses to direct messages, phone service has been off, they started well but been shit since
Itâ€™s all well and good offering businesses #cbils #bbls but so far has taken 6 weeks for one to process. Shambolic service from HSBC

@HSBC_UK did you know that the COVID-19 banner on your home page cannot be closed by clicking the X button in the top right corner? The &lt;div&gt; containing the "Need Help?" text on the right of the page covers the X, rendering it unclickable. Tested in Firefox, Edge &amp; Chrome on Mac.
@Hawthornman So even if we have an application reference number HSBC are saying everyone needs to re-apply? @HSBCUKBusiness #bbls #hsbc
@segwaybude @craigat94688475 @FINCHDEB @HSBC_UK Iâ€™m nigh on 40 yrs with them &amp; not heard a word from my application first thing Monday last ... I re-applied last night as something doesnâ€™t seem right &amp; I have an email confirming receipt of application now. Many now saying HSBC are claiming to not recognise reference numbers!

@firstdirecthelp what is the best way to deposit a cheque? Can I visit local HSBC bank? Or can I deposit at PO? Thanks
HSBC - I am being inundated with messages like this. Whether it is a rouge support person spouting the usual nonsense (possibly), many people have application ID's AND NO EMAIL, I am looking into it. For ref, the answer to this question is yes they are. https://t.co/wLDmbWOuyb

@djseanmathews Hey Sean, so sorry to hear. The best option is to get in touch with us via Live / Mobile chat to discus this further. ^RIT
@smokincabbie @Hrawli @mickab99 @banditcab @HSBC_UK That's what I thought. I'll call @BarclaysUKHelp today.
@HSBCUKBusiness We really need a BBLS contact point for the people that applied Monday. HSBC customers that applied Wednesday onwards are getting funds but not customers who applied before this. HAS SOMETHING GONE WRONG???
