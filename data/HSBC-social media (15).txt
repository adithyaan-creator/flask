@HSBCUKBusiness Pathetic response that your using for everyone. Why are HSBC the only bank having problems with the BBLS? The service I have received is appalling and is causing me stress as I need to know what money Iâ€™ve got coming in ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
@craig_removals @HightonK @Bounce_BackLoan @ting_tong22 @PhilPelucha @LondonSME1 @ShannonCallag19 @jono5757a @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness @StarlingBank Theyâ€™ve removed the FAQâ€™s as well about â€œpre-approvalâ€

To anyone reading the link in this letter (https://t.co/M1tWVMjhSZ) it is obvious, and evidenced, there has been a cover-up of massive #HSBCFraud. No journalist will touch it though. @OborneTweets https://t.co/kyddVhiQX5
Yo @HSBC_UK, you sent me a fraud text at half 11 this morning, which I replied to with a Y - Iâ€™ve heard nothing since. I spoke to someone who attempted to put me through to the fraud team but then just hung up. Can you help? My card just got declined in Asda.
@HSBCUKBusiness Honestly, I used to rate @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC but now I wouldnâ€™t recommend them to anyone. I applied last Tuesday and I havenâ€™t heard anything back and no one on the phone can help. Appalling service!

They say they are examining 13 bank transfers worth $17.4 million authorized by Mr. Rivera to an HSBC account in Hong Kong. Law enforcement officials say they consider the bank transfers authentic â€” and want to know how Mr. Rivera [Glasâ€™ uncle] deposited so much money in China.
@Bounce_BackLoan Wtf. No consistency whatsoever with hsbc.
@Bounce_BackLoan @paulkendall53 Do you think HSBC are the worst then ? When you see how starling bank are doing it annoys me even more to be honest

@MJ_Strutters Hi Mike, I appreciate where you are coming from, but payments into the Regular saver account should only be made via standing order, apart from the initial payment which is an inter account transfer. ^Laura
@HSBC_UK @Absolute_S_G How long are we looking at now? It's been two weeks since my first application and I've heard nothing. I applied 3 times and only got a confirmation on the 3rd one.
HSBC 4/4: by the end of this year. We see #GBPUSD falling this year before a modest reversal in 2021. #CAD will suffer a similar fate and we expect it to depreciate against USD in 2020.
HSBC 3/4: #GBP also looks vulnerable from a fiscal perspective with a high level of debt-to-GDP, large deficit and in need of foreign financing. This is before one considers the potential political tribulations of Brexit and risk that no trade deal is reached with European Union
HSBC 2/4: of the single currency zone. While we do not envisage a EUR break up, the market may put a greater price on this possibility, which will weigh on #EURUSD in our view.
HSBC 1/4: we expect the biggest losers from the U-shape recovery will be the #EUR, #GBP and #CAD. We believe that the fiscal imbalances &amp; inconsistencies across the Eurozone, without a clear plan to mutualise debt in some form, will see renewed questions about the sustainability
@Bounce_BackLoan I canâ€™t get to HSBC on the number can you send me the new number
@Absolute_S_G Please bear with us, weâ€™re working hard to make funds available as quickly as possible.2/2^Laura
@Absolute_S_G Hi there, We have received thousands of applications from business customers for bounce back loans. We are working through them as quickly as possible and will contact all those who have applied in the coming days.1/2^Laura
HSBC 2/2: should feel the benefit from a currency perspective. In this light, we believe the #AUD and #NZD will perform well.
HSBC 1/2: as economies do gradually start to emerge from the downswing, we would expect the health of respective fiscal positions to become the key driver of #G10 #currencies. Those with the most room to support their economies through the course of the drawn-out recovery
@HSBCUKBusiness Hi, Can you confirm when you will support open banking feeds on HSBC business Savings accounts?
@Bounce_BackLoan Joyful. Iâ€™ve applied and waiting for terms and conditions to be sent over the support manager Iâ€™m dealing with who will then pass on to me... surely HSBC have t&amp;câ€™s already?! ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ #iliveinhope

@HSBC_UK hi, My security key is out of battery and trying to get in online has locked me out. Iâ€™ve been told I have to go into branch. Only open between 10-2. I work full time from home with no leave until mid June. Is there any other way I can unlock without going into branch?
@HSBC_UK My understanding when I set up this account was that you could top up whenever you wanted to add more than the standing order. It seems illogical to be changing my standing order each month rather than just being able to top up as and when I want?

@MJ_Strutters Hi Mike, that's correct. What you'll need to do is amend the standing order to a higher amount when you want to top up the account. Make sure to do this 2 working days before the payment is due, if you're standing order is due within the next two days (1/2) ^Tijianne

@Bounce_BackLoan Hearing from a few clients that they just put there personal account details in with hsbc and so far one has been paid out so it's worth just puting personal account details in if waiting on feeder accounts, does any one know of anyone who has got a fedder account yet?
@HSBCUKBusiness Just chased my application for the 7th time. Applied for CBIL 14th April, told by HSBC to cancel it and apply for BBLS 2 weeks ago. They can't tell me when anything will happen and give an email address which auto replies saying it's not secure enough to discuss account info

Weekly Research Analystsâ€™ Ratings Changes for HSBC $HSBC https://t.co/vz6RHQUy1Q
HSBC 8/8: For a market that looks more priced for a V-shaped bounce this could create headwinds in coming months for #currencies most closely linked to global cycle. USD &amp; JPY are likely to remain well supported through an initial rise in #volatility caused by swings in sentiment
"HSBC 7/8: until late in 2021. This is also the case for most EM economies where some downturns look especially prolonged.
 In U-shaped recovery, we believe that there is likely to be a period of uncertainty as economic rebound takes time to emerge &amp; may offer occasional false hope"
"HSBC 6/8: U-shaped recovery most likely scenario
  
 Our central case is for a U-shaped recovery. This is aligned with the overwhelmingly negative economic data which looks like it will take some time to bottom out. For most G10 economies, output will not reach its end-2019 level"
"HSBC 5/8: 
 4. ï¼-shape â€” An extended downturn in growth, perhaps prompted by a second wave of containment measures. A ""Risk off' mood would ensue. Winners: Gold, JPY, USD, Losers: CAD, AUD, NZD"
"HSBC 4/8: 
 3. V-shape â€” A healthy and reasonable swift rebound in growth. ""Risk on-Risk off' is still dominant, as previous FX losers become the winners. Winners: AUD, NZD, CAD, Losers: Gold, USD, JPY, CHF"
"HSBC 3/8: 
 2. U-shape â€” The upswing fails to arrive immediately. FX is driven by the relative health of government finances as markets look for policy to deliver the upswing. Winners: USD, JPY, AUD, NZD, Losers: EUR, CAD, GBP"
"HSBC 2/8: We believe a U-shaped recovery is most likely:
 
 1. L-shape â€” The global economy fails to rebound even after the easing of #COVIDãƒ¼19 containment measures. FX is driven by the relative health of external positions. Winners: JPY, CHF, Gold, Losers: AUD, NZD, GBP"
HSBC 1/8: There is considerable uncertainty as to the future path of the #COVID19 pandemic and the associated economic trajectory. As such, we consider various possible scenarios that could play out and what these may mean for #G10 currencies. https://t.co/dkqzfPsFZG

"@mrwebber4 @SelfDestructCap @freegoldtube My expectation would be that the BoE, or its customers using it for storage facilities, are unlikely to have outright sold that gold to HSBC, so it can keep it for GLD.
 
 It seems far more likely that someone has leased bars in the BoE vault, to HSBC."
@HSBC_UK I have recieved a text today about a new payee from my account. I think this is a scam as I dont have an HSBC account. Advise please
"@DebraRo91758510 @LawrenceLepard Is there a possibility that HSBC suffers what could be said in human terms a 'mortal blow'
 
 If so why would management/regulators allow it?"
"@mrwebber4 @SelfDestructCap @freegoldtube HSBC cannot find enough allocated, or perhaps it cannot find it cheaper elsewhere than at the BoE?
 
 So it is outsourcing custody to BoE.
 
 And who can complain about that? I would rely on the BoE more than HSBC anyway, personally."

@BarclaysUKHelp Hi Ramona. No call back yet - still waiting. We are baffled as he's the only signatory. Must be creating more work as not be able to process online and have to call everyone? We are hearing the same from other folks who are now giving up and migrating over to Starling and HSBC
@HSBC_UK any chance of a call back? I canâ€™t be on hold for over an hour on a mobile phone seriously

@HSBC_UK trying to roll over mortgage. Iâ€™ve done my bit online, but the co-mortgagor (my wife) doesnâ€™t have that loan on her online profile (despite trying) so she canâ€™t accept the new mortgage offer. Your telephone colleagues are of no help. Please assist.
Still on hold, now approaching two hours! And no one has bothered answering my earlier tweet. What does that say about HSBC's attitude to customers?

@HSBC_UK it's unacceptable that today i was supposed to connect with a operator and it sounded like they answered only to have the call disconnected by them in a second. Most CS call agents should not even have the option to do that, this happened twice to me today.

@esrasaginc @MartinSLewis Itâ€™s awful service. On the plus side at least you know you have been accepted Iâ€™m stuck in limbo at the minute hoping the buisness survives but Iâ€™m sure @HSBC_UK donâ€™t care about that

@normanchris71 @Bounce_BackLoan I tried HSBC for a feeder account they said all good you will hear in 7 days and just rang them and they now say they have no idea how long it will take and how long it will be before I can get the loan either, couldn't even look on the system if my application was there @HSBC
@alixdeeee @MartinSLewis I bank with HSBC and a new credit account was opened alongside my business account, the day after I applied, which showed the funds I applied for. However, I canâ€™t access these funds, canâ€™t withdraw or transfer. They are just sitting there. Itâ€™s been two weeks. A joke.
Amazing service from @HSBC today â¤ï¸ The lovely chap got me sorted out with my mobile, online and phone banking after I got locked out (by my own stupidity). Took three weeks to get the code but his loveliness made up for it ðŸ˜Š
@MartinSLewis Need to get working with HSBC been 14 days and heard nothing im an existing customer aswell really poor service
@PembsDan @HSBC_UK How long is a piece of string feeder accounts do not exist as of yet I have been waiting from 4th of may
Booked slot tom. at 11am will take 1hr need to have ID etc ready. This will be simply to get a HSBC profile, pass KYC regs and get into the system ready for a Feeder account. Was honest and said if i bank with an accredited lender (I don't) it would be quicker to go with them.

It will be a week tomorrow since I applied for a #bouncebackloan with #Hsbc. Still not heard nothing have very little cash to keep a float which is running out quickly. @HSBCUKBusiness please sort it. @MartinSLewis @Bounce_BackLoan
Downloaded the app (the "activation code" is invalid on this device). Been asked to call again. Told that the person who answered would be fully briefed (no-one answered). Been promised a code through the post that never arrived. Pretty hopeless all round really @HSBC_UK
It was Apr 21 - 4 weeks ago tomorrow - that @HSBC_UK advised that online banking for children could be "set up in no time". Still waiting. Countless conversations on Twitter, lots of time listening to recorded phone messages (most asking us not to call with non-urgent enquiries).
@alexduffey Well, HSBC most certainly will, I can't speak for other banks. However to be covered by section 75, you'll need to have made a payment over Â£100...just for your information! Obviously, you'd still be covered under chargeback rules no matter how much the price is. ðŸ‘ ^Chris

@HSBC_UK I raised a credit card transaction dispute over 4 weeks ago and I haven't yet received an acknowledgement nor info on the next steps. Please can you provide me with an update.
HSBC - Useless but they do some big money drops. I am expecting one hopefully tonight https://t.co/30THYy8TXW
@Bounce_BackLoan I'm wondering what the options are going forward as an HSBC customer? I've given up with them now... cant move accounts elsewhere as no ones taking new customers. Starling and Tide are only options, but my other limited company has a BBL with starring... I'm screwed basically
Imagine @HSBC_UK rewarding a compensation fee after a technical error leaving me with no card then not putting it into my account, saying no money to be credited ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
@LarkdasGeorge @HSBCUKBusiness How long did it take @LarkdasGeorge for your funds to be accessible? We have ours today, but; weâ€™re same as you itâ€™s showing as available but itâ€™s not... we contacted HSBC and they said to go on live chat and get them to release the funds?? #Shambles @Bounce_BackLoan

@HSBC_UK The number I called was HSBCâ€™s customer helpline -it repeatedly cuts callers off. Even a DMâ€™s been ignored, despite a recorded message heard before being cut off that said thatâ€™s what I should do. And this link just takes me back to where I started. Iâ€™m in a hopeless HSBC loop.

@Bounce_BackLoan HSBC ....just wandered if youve had a few ppl waiting for t&amp;cs to be signed off on the temp bus account ( if you dont bank with hsbc ). I applied for account on the 5th but waited since for the t&amp;cs. At that point im told the account will be open within 24hrs

@Bounce_BackLoan I applied on 4th May - nothing. 11 May HSBC said to apply again - got conf email and next day got 000 echosign. Next day got the correct one, signed and got the 'You Have Signed' email, since then nothing! HSBC said on the phone today someone would call me but couldn't say when!

@HSBC all the outstanding amount in Jan 2020 but they still on interest and just keep the suspend amount and I not figure out. In May 2020 I call up again to request clear all the scheme and banker officer said need 5 working days to proceed. I very worry the case didâ€™t process
@HSBC the story is from when I apply this scheme which is only temporary use about 1 or 2 months, the banker said I can easily to settle off this plan with just give them a call. However I call up to banker officer to cancel off the cash advance instalment scheme and
@HSBC I feel very bad experience on cash advance instalment scheme since Dec 2019
