Thank you HSBC i dont get to eat tonight because you sent me a fraud alert when i was trying to order off deliveroo and said i should wait for a follow up text with instructions which never came! Went to online chat and your rep whos grammer was terrible could not even help as your fraud team are off for the night!
HSBC should know all about this. Mexico, Brazil... Biggest fraud in the UK is how HSBC treat 52,000 of their former Midland Bank staff pensioners. They  certainly didn't explain clawback and glibly told people they would get a 2/3 final salary pension. Lies! Now clawing back up to 30% from the lowest paid. Time to do the right thing HSBC and drop clawback. I doubt Ian Stuart, Noel Quinn or anybody in a senior post will ever read this and they certainly seem to only have their own best interests at heart. Interesting that the bank's pension trustees are contacting people to put themselves forward as a pension scheme trustee but have pointedly not contacted any of the clawback campaign committee.
HSBC is an international bank so call centres can be based anywhere...... stay safe Philippine‚Äôs wishing everyone and their families well
"Maybe put your call centres in the UK. I never used to believe the bloke I was talking to was really called ‚ÄúMichael‚Äù when he had such a shocking level of English. 
However, that aside HSBC wrote off a debt to them due to my disability and acted really really kindly and nicely with empathy and compassion, so I am impressed with them. "
Okay HSBC might not be the best bank in the country but they are a worldwide bank and when I lived in Canada for 5 years they helped me setup an account over there, so before you lot blast this post, just take a step back and think about the people who work out there in Manila and what it must be like for them right now, even with this Covid pandemic that has put us all into lockdown, these people and the call centres are doing their best in a bad situation, no matter if it‚Äôs a bank, your broadband provider, whoever they are working as best as they can, I used to work for a call centre and the amount of abuse that I‚Äôve seen staff take it can have a negative effect on their mental health so give that some consideration please. üëäüòäüëä
THERE IS ALWAYS AN EXCUSE WITH HSBC - FIRST COVID 19 - NOW TYPHOONS - JUST KEEP GOING - SO IF I HAVE TO LIQUIDATE MY ACCOUNT I WILL AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE THE DEBT. BECAUSE IM SICK OF WAITING HOURS ON THE PHONE TO TALK ABOUT THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
Watch Netflix HSBC documentary - ethical? NOPE...
I would love to donate again this year. Unfortunately though HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance. Unfortunately for myself and my staff they have not kept to their word. I know this is a pointless post but just wanted to say they are certainly not all sweetness and light as they are trying to make out
How about making some updates to your UK staff pensions.  52,000 suffering outdated, unfair and immoral clawback. Some of the lowest paid staff now having 30% of their already small pension taken back, although you look after the senior managers by only taking back 2% from their high pensions! Time to do the right thing HSBC. Ian Stuart, Noel Quinn take a good look at your group standards and then try applying them to your older and longer serving staff and pensioners. Remove clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk
That‚Äôs a great job üíê done by HSBC, hope other local banks can come forward like this and help the nation. 
42 days since applying for a business account with zero progression ... madness HSBC ! What is going on ?? Told now the wait time is not known ... terrible
"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November. Consequently I have this week spent a total of 6 hours and 10 minutes in phone calls with Barclaycard over a 4 day perios who have also confirmed the information given by HSBC was inaccurate. Subsequently I have once again this afternoon phoned HSBC only to be CUT OFF for the second time after forty minutes. 

This has now left me with no other option than to contact:
1: The financial ombudsman 
2. BBC Watchdog
3: A researcher I know personally who works for a well known TV show that exposes and brings to public attention situations like this.

It's absolutely astounding that all I wanted to do was make a simple balance transfer! 

If you are going to employ cheap monkeys to operate a business, you can expect to turn into a zoo, which judging by the reviews here, you've succeeded. 

Absolutely appalling service.

Had enough of hsbc (not even worth caps lock!) You are not helpful in the slightest!
It's great that you're training customer-facing colleagues. Maybe this means that there will BE some customer-facing colleagues. For now it doesn't seem to be the case. 4 hours on the phone with your 'customer service' and no one picked up. My card dispute is 5 months old now, soon I'll give it a name and celebrate its first birthday. Can't wait to leave HSBC!
HSBC currently due to lockdown to wait and reach the operators from abroad is expensive. So, it would be beneficial if we can arrange a direct call with the operator and then catch up. Otherwise to wait 15-20 minutes is impossible by international calls.

HSBC is a joke been trying to get through for 4 months yes 4 MONTHS on hold again tonight for an hour far too stressful been banking with you for 30 years you are a disgrace if you opened for more than 4 hours  day I would withdraw all money and close my account
I wish to complain that there should be a method that works to communicate with HSBC. If one method does not work then another should be available even if it takes a while to reply. At the moment it seems no method is available for me to communicate after logging on which is not good enough. Also the chatline should answer the questions I actually ask. If not, then they need education in English!
"Hi just to let you know that I have had a message saying that HSBC secrity alert - a transfer to a new payee has been detected.  if you didnt authorise this cancel  from 07310 908711
I havent clicked it to it I have reported it as spam and blocked it."

HSBC have a pretty bad record full stop. Highly UNRECOMMEND
I'll be shutting my account HSBC down being associated with charity and the bbc
HSBC - my husband (who doesn‚Äôt have Facebook) is at his wits end trying to get in touch. Been ringing for days and still waiting an hour later. He has just changed banks to yourself and the switching process is due to complete 6th November but no telephone banking number so can‚Äôt register online. Everything apart from that has arrived in the post. I have sent a PM but no response. Please can someone help
Go away HSBC/. Just concentrate on running a legitimate business first instead of these surface pr soundbites....
This Racist History Month HSBC is doing what it always does and virtue signalling while doing absolutely nothing to help customers during coronavirus

Outrageous how hsbc treat customers. Was a great bank 10 years ago, but won't recommend now. Took an hour on the phone to them for a simple reser, now discovered an insane overdraft interest rate targeting poor customers in this climate. Should charge more than 25 pounds a month. I was hit with 50 pound bill. They encourage debt.
You talk about dreams but you are destroying mine.. Im heartbroken that you've undervalued my flat by 20,000. I adopted a dog who's owner is now too ill too take him back and I've fallen in love with him but I can't keep him in my flat so I was buying a house which has now fallen through because you have undervalued my flat so much. Please help me and reconsider HSBC
"Just had a message from you stating that you have tried to call.  We let it go to answer phone, googled number and it's an harassment number from India.

Your Twitter account also showed that it was not a genuine phone number for HSBC in response to someone else.  0800 7838422

https://twitter.com/hsbc_uk/status/1291664175459192832"
AFTER 2 HOURS YOUR WASTE OF SPACE CUSTOMER SERVICES JUST ANSWERED THE PHONE. TOLD ME TO GO TO THE FINANCIAL OMBERSMAN AND THAT WAS THAT. ALSO TOLD ME THAT YOU ARE PRIORITISING NEW CUSTOMERS FOR BOUNCE BANK LOANS SO US LOYAL EXISTING BUSINESS BANK CUSTOMERS ARE NOT CURRENTLY PRIORITY. BYE BYE HSBC YOU TOTAL MUPPETS
"Four times I phoned your dispute team on Monday 1st time waited 50 minutes, 2nd 20 minutes then another 50 minutes finally was answered only to be told that it was not the dispute department even though that was the number they asked me to phone. Young lady tried to help then put me on hold for the dispute department after a hour and 15 minutes gave up. 
Got through yesterday was answered in 50 minutes went through my dispute sent paperwork while on phone and was told they would phone be back today(was on phone just over an hour). Phoned me back today told she couldn‚Äôt help me put me on hold for dispute team after over an hour come back and told me to phone another number have asked them to phone me back but not expecting them to just want my money back never mind giving new customers ¬£125 this customer will be moving on after 34 years with HSBC."
"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.
Within 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - ¬£4000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!
HSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.
Ontop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.
HSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.
I HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY GET SHUT DOWN!"
..my goodness, the service from HSBC is terrible. They don't seem to care, looking at the posts here. I've been trying to get through to discuss my mortgage - no luck whatsoever, from phone or chat
I've been with HSBC for over 20 year, Well not for much longer. Crap customer service, stupid security questions like "where did you spend ¬£x two weeks ago last Thursday". I'm now looking to move banks.
This is quite frankly sick.Read up on the record of HSBC and it's ethics......NOT much human rights there folks.....
I am not having a good experience setting up my new HSBC account and registering on-line.  I want to register so I can start to invest money in my new current account and also one or more savings accounts and I have no telephone security number which I must have to proceed.  Visited a branch and was told it would be posted to me, and nothing has arrived, phoned the number advertised on your website several times, which is not a good experience and expensive, and twice spoke to an agent who said it had been posted, and still nothing has arrived.  I am starting to think I have made a mistake in starting the switching process and I must say your customer service could and should be improved.
An hour on chat to try to get a new bank card. An hour on the phone. Then they cancel the wrong card so I have no cards. Sons ill. Grocery delivery will be cancelled and a world of difficulty. The solution? ‚ÄúBorrow some money from a friend.‚Äù What has happened to you HSBC? Customer service used to be amazing. Now the wait to speak to someone is horrendous. Chat doesn‚Äôt work as they‚Äôre doing multiple conversations at once, I‚Äôm just waiting for 45 minutes just for someone to acknowledge that I‚Äôm waiting. I‚Äôm on hold again now, 16 minutes into yet another call to again request that my joint account card is reissued. 
mmmm I was considering switching but have had no reply to a question I sent on messenger. After reading some of these comments not sure if I will..... I thought HSBC had a good reputation ????
This is the third credit check HSBC has done on my current account, with  regards to opening my business bank account, never had so many credit checks done on me, left a mark in my credit history you bet they have. This has been going on for 19 weeks, it will be 20 weeks this week. Promise after promise ‚Äúit‚Äôs at quality control, so should be open this week never week at the latest‚Äù lies and more lies. Two hours a day I spend on the phone every day getting this sorted, when I should be running my business, to get nothing and the guy today wasn‚Äôt even trying to be nice. Bet I get a generic reply to this, because they can‚Äôt even face the people they are letting down.
Hi HSBC, I've sent you a message but not heard back - is anyone actually checking your messages?
**Terrible bank** Stay clear everyone, you will not be happy with their service I can tell you!! I'd not even recommend this shabby set of people to my worst enemy!! Honestly I'd sooner crap in my goggles and blink than ever bank with HSBC again!!..***
Many foreign students are trying to open their account to HSBC but due to lack of facilities they turn down other banks UK
HSBC suddenly switches to 'right on' black rights when it suits there marketing strategy..... YUK
Hey I can't access an account for a vulnerable person as her appointed POA, I never ever wanted to use HSBC but I have to respect the wishes of this customer, my HSBC card is actually issued in the wrong name even though I produced all my documents at a local branch 18 miles away.i refused to go back with the same documents as life is too short
How long does it take  for hsbc to process current accounts application
So, I took over as Chair of a Community Group which have an account with HSBC in Feb. In September, believing the bank would by now be contact-able to sort out bank accounts. Over 90 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered, unclear forms to fill out and then a letter sent to the wrong address saying it was done wrong and to phone the original number. Now back waiting on the same phone number again just to get in contact with someone. Such bad service. Unless things are resolved, our organisation will be moving accounts - that is if we can actually get in touch with someone! So bad - avoid if you are a community group :-(
I‚Äôm still on hold since 9am this morning listening to the HSBC musicü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
HSBC telephone banking is an appsalupely useless service its not fit for purpose I think the advisors have fell asleep on the other end of the line.

HSBC caring more about racist blacks than its customers
I applied to HSBC bounceback loan in july. I got a conformation email and since have had nothing.  I have spent 7 hours in total listening to the mind warping music on hold and have not spoken to anyone and  have a business account with HSBC. Shocking!
Applied for BBL with you guys in AUGUST!! Apart from an email confirming my application I've heard nothing! Hours and hours of waiting on the phones for you to answer. The BBL scheme was supposed to be there to help people with their businesses during difficult times. How are you helping exactly? My son did his with Natwest, ten days between application and receiving the money. HSBC are appalling!! 
I feel infuriated with HSBC right now. I‚Äôve been trying to open back accounts for my 2 older children. I have banked with you for many years and my family have worked for you, so I‚Äôm loyally trying time keep with you. However I‚Äôve now tried for 6 weeks to open accounts for the children. I‚Äôve had 3 different messages on phone, originally telling me I could now apply online, then no, then to make an appointment, then no. Now your new opening hours mean I actually can‚Äôt get them to the bank as you are open for school hours. Very frustrating. 
So on the 13-10-2020 i applied for a Business bank account (after being made redundant). After numerous telephone calls spending hours on the phone, mostly on hold im informed that im  unable to open a business account 21-10-2020. Ive been a customer for 20 years. The email suggested that a credit check was undertaken for borrowing !!! I do not wish to borrow any money or require any funding. Im now self employed new business and busy working unable to sped hours on hold waiting for answers being put through to this department that department. Ive tried the appeal on line form and it continually times out. I require an account so that my clients can pay me. Totally disgusted with the whole process. I tried to book an appointment with a local bank shut on Saturdays and 4pm in the week (i have to work). I spoke to a guy in business this morning and he tells me the application has been closed. Extremely annoyed. HSBC please contact me regarding opening an account to place funds into ASAP.
You're not here to help 50,000 of your own pensioners that you impose pension clawback on! Some of the lowest paid, mainly women, losing over 30% of their hard-worked for pensions, whilst the highest paid and fatcats suffer hardly anything! Not fair and it was not properly explained to the majority of those staff. Imagine retiring on a pension of less than ¬£10,000 a year and then having a third of that taken back simply because you start receiving the meagre State Pension. HSBC your share price might be suffering and you might have issues around the China/USA trade war, plus you might still have issues surrounding money laundering and such like BUT you can still afford to remove the unfairness and inequity of clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk
It‚Äôs a shame when you say you‚Äôre open, but when you call it say, this office is now closed. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è worst banking ever. Wish I was left to open the bank account because it would‚Äôve not been HSBC 
Been waiting over a month for our new business account to be activated! Can't speak to anyone, hold on the phone for hours. Told we will get updates on email and we get nothing. How can a new business survive these tricky times if we can't invoice our jobs??? Can anyone at HSBC actually help me with this?? Not just an answer phone telling me to press number after number to be told they won't discuss business accounts down the bloody phone!!!!!
The service I have received from HSBC in India is appalling. No one takes ownership. No one cares patheic
Well HSBC are you really helping people and businesses out? I applied for my bounce back loan over 2 months ago, wrote multiple emails, spent hours on the phone and still nothing! You are letting small business to fail in these difficult times! Every other week I get the same answer to check my emails, but nothing is happening!
@HSBC beyond all reasoning now!! 4 time my husband has tried to call, each time 2 hours getting through!!!! Twice got through! Twice put on hold but actually hung up on!!! This is not acceptable üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° 8 hours in total and nothing is done!!!

"Appalled and utterly dissapointed at how terrible hsbcs customer service has become. Wasting a vast amount of my time and repeatedly giving me the wrong information. 
What caused this level of incompetence and uselessness?"
Very disappointed with the abysmal customer service at the HSBC in Harrow, London, this afternoon. Two apparent customer service 'assistants' barked at me to queue TWICE from outside the bank because I needed to use two machines inside the bank, to withdraw and deposit money from my accounts! In addition, two of the three deposit machines inside the bank did not work! I refused to queue twice or give any credence to two rude, jumped up, good for nothing customer service agents and as a result HSBC missed out on my deposit and most likely my future business! Perhaps HSBC should divert resources into maintaining their 'self service' machines instead of employing unhelpful assistants that are obsessed with marshalling queues, lost on a deluded mini power trip and have an unnerving propensity to shout at their customers!#SHOCKING-SUB-STANDARD-CUSTOMER-SERVICE!

I have been a customer with HSBC for over 20 years, and the service I have got is beyond appalling. I have been waiting for over 18 weeks for my business account to be opened, I have been promised week after week that it will be open next week, so I have waited. I have a time sensitive grant that will run out next week, which I need for my business and has to be put into a business account. I am having to do all the extra work of managing business finances in my current account so it doesn‚Äôt get mixed up. No one is giving me any clear answers. You have pushed my business to the edge.
Nowadays most of programs are based in Birmingham  centenary square‚õ≤Ô∏è. HSBC already started to decreasing üé¢ their branches in London & if they continue like this, very soon HSBC Canary Wharf will be in the list of closedown. So HSBC üá¨üáß need to do same celebrations in London also. 
What a joke of a Bank.Had a fraud alert sent to me from HSBC and guess what...... can‚Äôt get hold of anyone, just constantly on hold.Moved all the money out of my HSBC account into my Halifax account and to be honest that‚Äôs where it will stay.Dreadful service!!!
HSBC customer service is quite frankly disgusting at the moment. Organisations have had 7 months to put measures in place and yet still appallingly slow service is being blamed on COVID-19. Last week took 6 attempts to obtain a redemption statement, by the time it was finally sent the expiry date meant not enough time to complete on a new mortgage so back to square one. New one requested on 24th, here we are 6 days later and still no sign of it. Not good enough.
I‚Äôm with you.  I‚Äôve had an account for 40 years.  Need to make an important payment.  Have spent hours on the phone today - speaking to over 5 members of staff - line gone dead twice.  For no reason they‚Äôve decided that they don‚Äôt trust the payee despite my assurances that I have triple checked the details.  Now suspended access to my bank account.  Now saying that can‚Äôt make the payment until I‚Äôve gone into a branch and proved my identity.  No branches open this weekend.  HSBC won‚Äôt let me use my account and jeopardising my future for no reason at all.  Have put in a complaint but won‚Äôt be actioned in time.  Disgraceful treatment of a long standing customer.  I‚Äôm astonished that they would do this.
What a shame you don't put as much effort into helping your loyal pensioners and stop applying Clawback which you shamelessly call a state deduction. Do the right thing HSBC. #midlandclawback
Just under three hours on hold trying to get through regarding BBLS (5 months and counting) and then I got disconnected once someone answered. Shocking. How anyone has stayed with HSBC as a customer is beyond me. I have emailed you using the response email someone posted below, hoping someone will do the decent thing and respond to me...
Hsbc your telephone and internet service is beyond a joke! Your can‚Äôt keep blaming Covid-19 your are the only company I have had such horrendous problems with and your wait time is awful
I would like to know why HSBC have changed my name on my accounts to a name I have never been and now I am having trouble to sort them out because you want proof of my name to which I have never been but my mortgage is in the right name, all I want is the interest from paying my mortgage off early in a cheque that is in the right name so I can cash it and also why have you changed my name on my sons trust fund to the name I am not or have never been. I have filled in a change of name form over 3 weeks ago, I have given you all the proof you need to see that I am not that name, I have rang you up to have the phone put down on me, I have been in branch 3 times but you keep sending me letters in the name I have NEVER been
So disappointed with HSBC.  My daughter has just reported a fraud on her account and has spent two days on the 'phone trying to get it resolved.  "Halifax", on the other hand, who were also involved have been fantastic
I have been trying to contact HSBC for two days. I cannot activate my replacement secure key for online banking, I go in store and they tell me to contact by phone. I've been on the phone twice each time on hold for 2 hours. Also, live chat is not working online. I am effectively frozen out of my business account and cannot access. This is now affecting our business. I need this issue to be fixed now because - payments to make ASAP.
"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.

Day by day HSBC üá¨üáß service is getting down & closing of branches particularly in villages areas which is not a good sign of  the ‚ÄúWorld's local bank‚Äù.
I also bank with Lloyds, Nationwide and Santander - and I can honestly say HSBC is the SLOWEST and POOREST customer service. I have been waiting for a bounceback loan to come through for a very long time, no word, no email, no letters - totally unnacceptable. This is a government scheme and the bank should sort this out as a matter of priority. Why does it take 2 hours for someone to answer the phone, and when they do they don't know how to help?? The lockdown excuse is wearing thin now. Most people are back at work! Terrible.
#HSBC up to your old fraudulent tricks again. Ironic that just yesterday I mention it and I receive what was a LTD business statement now in a Sole Trader account so you can come for money directly. Disgusting. Limited liability is limited liability and your choice to change that is FRAUD. anyone reading this avoid HSBC like the plague. They are disgusting greedy fraudulent pigs
HSBC just closed it‚Äôs Birmingham Sheldon Branch in which I got the account.... HSBC needs to stop ‚úã branch openings scams. Many business owners opened account due to new branches, but now they transferred it to to Solihull Branch which is far away from Sheldon.
For more protection against fraud, don't use HSBCs online banking and don't trust their incompetent fraud department that blocks your transactions but allows fraudulent transactions and does nothing because they expect you to know all about it
I‚Äôve been offered a business overdraft which I do not want. Have been on hold for over an hour and slowly giving up hope of speaking to anyone. There‚Äôs no way of knowing whether I‚Äôm next in the queue or have 100‚Äôs of people in front of me. All I want to do is reject the overdraft as I know HSBC will charge me for this!!! Really bad show
It is a scam what HSBC is doing to their staff's pensions! #fightforfairness
Never had a problem with HSBC been wirh them since they were Midland Bank
"I applied for a bounce back loan in June still waiting now !!!! Complained and all hsbc have said is due to high volume they will be in contact don‚Äôt know where to go and I have banked with them for over 30 years !!! 

Very poor service "
I think HSBC are well versed and can give good advice with regards to fraud operations. Just listen to today's news about money laundering. The bank have been down this road before!

And still nothing Sarah.  This is disgraceful.  I've urgently asked for an Email address for complaints, but no reply as yet.   Being an HSBC customer used to be a pleasure, but its not the bank I joined 40 years ago
I would like to say a massive thank you to HSBC and the telephone staff! Someone was using my card and you help me thorough the process of stopping it immediately! You were friendly and efficient! I will always bank HSBC
Scamming lol? Hsbc are the biggest scammers ever, have held my account and all by funds for a ‚Äòreview‚Äô still no update and no funds! Business is fully down the drain now with a lot of debt to be cleared which were meant to be done through the funds that hsbc have held! Complaints made and no outcomes . Biggest scammers ever. Suffering mental depression because of this so called bank!
Dear  HSBC,  could  someone  from  the  ‚Äúvery  responsive‚Äù to messages  please  respond to  the  messages   have  been  sending  for  tye the past twenty  minutes?   I  can‚Äôt  phone  you  as  I  don‚Äôt have  phone  banking  set  Up,I  can‚Äôt access  my account  and i I cannot get  any  help/support  from  you.  Is  anyone  there?
Yep and HSBC doing very little to help solve this.  What is your fraud line number and how quick to you respond?
HSBC my wife tried to log on to business banking as usual on Sunday but it was immediately rejected saying that there were too many failed attempts. She followed the process including printing a form, completing it, taking a photo and uploading it. She has not heard from you. So this afternoon she called the main HSBC number for help. After 60 minutes of being on hold she ended the call. She then called the number that was on the form, despite being continually informed that she was in a priority queue, after 90 minutes of being on hold, she ended the call. That is two and half hours of lost time. We have never experienced such a poor service from any organisation before. What do you suggest?
Our so called HSBC gold plated pension after clawback is not worth a brass tack!
I don't need HSBC to tell me how to budget thank you, although I have had many financial reviews with HSBC.  Pity their own Financial Planning Managers  never mentioned HSBC would keep 22% of my small company pension for themselves when I reach State Pension age. I am a loyal employee with 43 years' service and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known. Shame on you HSBC. Do the right thing and get rid of this unfair out if date practice like the others have, CLAWBACK has no place in this modern world.
Perhaps i would not have to look for loose change around my sofa, if HSBC stopped taking 20% of my bank pension 
So we are being taught to budget by HSBC. How ironic. Their employees budget carefully for retirement only to find that at state pension age HSBC claw money back from their pensioners who then have to budget again because they have less money. HSBC think that it is acceptable because it was ‚Äòclearly communicated‚Äô when we all joined the bank many years ago. Funny that they won‚Äôt provide definitive proof of this as these pensioners only found about this ‚Äòstate deduction‚Äô as HSBC call it as it started affecting some many years later and after many years of loyal service. Look to your business morals HSBC as other companies did many years ago and reverse this state deduction. #fightingforfairness
Shame we didn‚Äôt have this advice over 40 years ago and known we were going to have to search down our sofas as Midland Bank/HSBC Staff Pension scheme was going to be ‚ÄúClawed‚Äù back off us. I‚Äôm certain had loyal staff known this, or been advised of this from the beginning we would have changed our career paths, I know I would have. It‚Äôs a disgrace! 
Thought I had budgeted until HSBC unfairly discriminated against me for starting my career in a particular time frame.  Shame on you Midland Bank /HSBC - only 50% of pension for the lowest paid staff, 30% clawed back by the bank and 20% tax. Doesn't apply to the highest paid though. What a surprise. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk for details and case studies.
HSBC I tell you what we are tired of, the bank trying to portray itself as the best at this, the best at that, and still ripping off it's pensioners by taking part of their state pension.  You say it was "part of the scheme and clearly communicated". Hogwash !!  Many ex staff won't get a full state pension anyway because you contracted us all out but conveniently forgot to say that means you will get a reduced state pension.  The only thing you are best at is dumping on your staff from a great height, you'd win awards for that.
I have moved home from living abroad and need to access my recent transactions and then close my hsbc uk bank account eventually. I am locked out of my hsbc app due to not having a security key and not having the same phone number or address in which originally opened my bank account and therefore cannot access my account!!! Everytime I try to call the number on your website or message you facebook it says your centre is closed!!!!!!
Managing our budgets is an interesting concept from HSBC. My wife and I have 60 years employment with them combined and were never advised of clawback ... or 'state deduction' as they did refer to it so we all thought it was the government deducting not them. Yet they claim clear and consistent communication yet can provide no proof. Even their trust company and later pfs advisors never mentioned it. Budgeting advise Ha Ha. My wife and I lose a considerable part of our pensions at 66/67.
"HSBC there are scam emails going about requesting details or the account will be closed 
I know this is a scam as I‚Äôm not a customer "
Hey HSBC how much of our pension money have you stuffed down your dirty sofa? Shameful.
Interesting advertisement. I have had many financial reviews with HSBC.  Pity their own Financial Advisors never mentioned HSBC would keep a chunk of my relatively small company pension for themselves when I reached State Pension age. I was a loyal employee for almost 40 years and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known.
Shame on you HSBC, I thought I had budgeted for my retirement, only to find out I was 'losing' ¬£125 a month from my small pension, I'm lucky enough to have a husband with a pension as I'm pretty sure I couldn't manage without him and our joint pensions, really feel for anyone on their own trying to manage. Shame on you HSBC!!!!!
Thought I did budget for my retirement until I found out HSBC will clawbank some of my staff pension. Shame on you HSBC we were told how  great our pensions were and it was all part of our package/salaries.
When is what HSBC termed state deduction (which staff presumed was the reduced pension we also suffer because we were contracted out for NI) not actually a state deduction?  It‚Äôs when HSBC clawback 23% of my pension and unbelievably call it state deduction. I‚Äôve now got 2 deductions. The real state deduction which affects my state pension and the unexpected STATE DEDUCTION which is actually HSBC robbing my already meagre bank pension and NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STATE. The biggest mistake of my life was to think HSBC was a reputable  employer. It‚Äôs a shameful company that does not practise what it preaches.
HSBC you should be ashamed of yourselves! We were all told what a brilliant pension we were agoing to get. But in reality it was all a sham! You were actually going to use the state pension to subsidise your own scheme! ie clawback the equivalent of the state pension from your hard working ex staff when they reach state pension age! Mainly effecting the lowest paid and predominantly women. Shame on you!
Would be able to manage my own future finances better if HSBC didn't clawback a large chunk of my pension when I reach 67, not something that was ever discussed with me.
Hsbc help your own retired staff budget by not clawing back their hard earned pensions #dotherighthing

Applied for Bounce Back Loan over 2 months ago and still waiting to get even a reply!! Any attempt to get information has been ignored. HSBC is definitely not the bank when it comes to small business support !!
I applied for my feeder account so I can get my bounce back loan in May, I finally got it in August, I applied for my Bounce back loan, still no response. The financial implications of this slow response may hit me very hard. Too hard to be honest. HSBC is destroying my life with their incompetence 
"HSBC A DISPUTE WAS OPEN IN MAY AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. THE PAYMENT WAS MADE ON A CREDIT CARD BY LAW MY REFUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROCESSED BY NOW.

I have unrecognised transactions on my account and nobody will refund them. They total ¬£940.00 and it has made me overdrawn and unable to buy food. I am hungry and it's now 37 hours since I ate anything because HSBC is holding the money hostage from me
Been on the phone to Hsbc for the last 2 evenings trying to get a refund for my son!! Your staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. My son now will have bank charges through no fault of his own!! Things are difficult enough at present with the global pandemic without being robbed of money people don‚Äôt have! Every other bank/business are trying to help people but Hsbc are not helpful at all in fact the attitude of the 7 staff that I‚Äôve already spoken to over the last 2 days is disgusting! I‚Äôm hoping I can get someone to help me today before my son gets any further into debt thanks to Hsbc üò°

My parents have banked with you for years! They went into their local branch for some help and advice only to be told there was on one who could help them! Than went back to try and sort out online banking only to be told to go home and do it them selves. Their both in their 70s and are in no way stupid but they are old fashioned and wanted face to face help. To set up online banking you need a telephone security code which they don‚Äôt have and we‚Äôre not told they needed in branch. When my dad mentioned about moving banks the assistant just said good luck with that!!
You have all these adverts saying how your there to help in different ways to suit customers needs !!! "
It‚Äôs rare I complain but feel frustrated. I‚Äôve been to my local HSBC branch in Meadowhall only to find that now they are closed on a Saturday! Most people who are working can‚Äôt get to branch during the reduced hours on a Monday to Friday. Saturday is the only day I can get to pay in cash. It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if there was a paying in machine outside the branch but there isn‚Äôt! How about close one day in the week and open on a Saturday to offer a service to working people.

HSBC your customer service is an absolute shambles. I have been waiting over 10 weeks for a response and still nothing. What a joke
HSBC's treatment of their business customers is abolutley shocking, I have been with the bank for 6 and half years running a small but profitable limited company, all of a sudden my accounts are all frozen, after spending a full day on hold nobody would tell me why, 5 days later I receive a letter saying the account is going to be shut down, no explanation as to why and I can't even get in touch with anyone to find out what is going on. This treatment is absolutley disgusting, they have crippled my business for no good reason. I run a small online company and can think of no reason why my account should be closed down. I would advise anyone thinking of opening an account with HSBC to think twice before they do, a simple search online will highlight the fact that I am not the only one who has had their business account closed without warning, HSBC have closed down hundreds of business accounts in the UK without warning or explanation, sort it out HSBC

I'm absolutely disgusted with HSBC's customer service. I spent nearly an hour yesterday on the phone trying to make an appointment with the branch for my son to open a student account. We are both existing customers. I have been with HSBC for over 30 years. We were told that there are no branch appointments at the moment due to Covid, but we simply had to take I'd, proof of student status into the branch and we would be able to open one from there. We went into the branch today to be turned away and told to open the account online and that they could not help us in the branch...very unhelpful and certainly not what I've come to expect from HSBC... we will be taking our business elsewhere in the future.

HSBC - your having a laugh aren‚Äôt you. My parents, in their late 70s, have recently been a victim of fraud, having thousands that they cannot afford taken out of their account. They went to a branch, only to be told they would have to call. They have called 3 times this week, spent a total of 8 hours on the phone, only to be cut off each time. I‚Äôm assuming you clearly don‚Äôt care about your customers, even if they are elderly and vulnerable 
HSBC seem to be offering fake help too. #bankingfraud #bankingscam

Taking of Fairer tales. How about the one concerning a female branch clerk who has given 40 years of her life to the bank, some part-time and some full-time, who retires on a pension of ¬£15k a year, only to find the bank claw back 30% of that when she hits State Pension Age - compared to a senior male manager who retires on ¬£150k a year but inly has 2% a year clawed back from his huge pension. HSBC claim that is fair and equitable! See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk

Every day i go to bank. their only response is higher team is looking this matter
I have tried to privately message you but it won‚Äôt go through. I have written to hsbc on Instagram but they directed me to you. I made a payment to my neighbour over some marketing work she helped me with as I have been building a website as I haven‚Äôt worked since March due to Covid. I add the payment and by mistake - it went to an old account Madderson that she was involved in but the account Should have bounced back as it was closed. I spoke to my bank immediately at Barclays and they sent a message giving you my neighbours personal details to put the money in. The problem is nothing has happened and now this is causing w problem with mh neighbour as she still needs to be paid and I haven‚Äôt earned money since March so this is causing a lot of stress.

HSBC Bloody useless bank! Ignore these supposedly positive posts,  I cannot understand how unresponsive they are,  don't deserve to be in business considering the way they treat,  or, rather ignore their customers.  Been waiting nearly 13 weeks for bounce back loan,  chased sign-off docs, signed them three weeks ago, was told money would be in account within 48 hours, still nothing! AND that is after chasing it up upteen times, Bank Manager been on the case for last almost  2 weeks, he's getting no-where, apparently.  Anyone thinking of joining this bank should think twice, as I know lots of people leaving it!  I have been with the bank for 35 years, when it was Midland Bank, since becoming HSBC, it has slowly gone down hill to an incompetent mess!

Ontop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.

Hi ,WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it‚Äôs simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar"
Is it okay if I use my hsbc account outside UK. The code will not close working
"25 minutes on the phone to some GUY I can barely understand
Locked out of online banking
Locked out of telephone
EVEN AFTER 25 minutes NO PROGRESS
THEN HE CUTS ME OFFTHE LINE
YOU COULD NOT MAKE IT UP
Take your money elsewhere and save the heartache
HSBC you are a JOKE!!"
HSBC Bloody useless bank!  Been waiting nearly 12 weeks for bounce back loan,  chased sign-off docs, signed them three weeks ago, was told money would be in account within 48 hours, still nothing! AND that is after chasing it up upteen times, Bank Manager been on the case for last week, he's getting no-where, apparently.  Anyone thinking of joining this bank should think twice, as I know lots of people leaving it!  I have been with the bank for 35 years, when it was Midland Bank, since becoming HSBC, it has slowly gone down hill to an incompetent mess!
"Dear HSBC

I have been on hold now for an hour with your telephone service.  This is not an exaggeration.  

Please would you arrange for a member of staff to answer the telephone."
We recently changed our business address (on the phone) and I specifically asked whether HSBC had all of the information needed - and said that no other details had changed. Now I have a letter saying you don't have our email address and need to ring you. I have waited 54, 34 and now 35 minutes on the support line to get to talk to an adviser. still not happened. Useless and unacceptable
Well, I was going to complain about your telephone banking system, but it seems many many others have beaten me to it....no wonder your "experiencing a high number of calls"...all I would like is someone to call me back so I don't have to spend another hour getting through, only to be cut off by the HSBC staff I ended up talking to.
"Dear All
HSBC talks about wanting REAL RELATIONSHIPS with their customers
Yet they resolve problems by EMAIL- KERRI MILLS head of customer service
JUST PICK UP THE PHONE ‚Äì like in the old days ‚Äì when customer service meant something

Regards
Roger Wills"
"Still no contact from 
KERRI MILLS AND HER CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM
What do customers have to do to get anything resembling customer service??
Mr Hugh Pugsley- Counsel-what do we have to do?
Without customer service Banks have nothing
Mr Noel Quinn ‚ÄìCEO-What do we have to do?
IF GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU
Do not repeat do not BANK with HSBC
Otherwise you will end being treated like my 83 year old father
