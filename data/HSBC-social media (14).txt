@alixdeeee @HSBC I applied for the original loan 23rd March. Didnâ€™t hear a thing despite chasing. Was advised to reapply for the BBL instead when that went live. Applied, got an email to say Iâ€™ll receive something to sign digitally but not heard a thing since. Now 8 days, Absolutely appalling.
@MetroBank_Help @BrightelmPCO Jumping on this thread: I see metrobank website states they have now applied - do you have any idea when you will be accepted? I ask as HSBC will offer to non customers but will take longer to do and don't want to start process if Metro will be up and running soon. thanks
Good work @SamConniff. I was with @firstdirect for about 20 years but left them because First Direct's owners, @HSBC have been naughty boys and girls when it comes to questionable ethics. Now happily with @triodosuk https://t.co/E07nPAz3SA
Dilemma - I'd quite like my lunch, but I'm on hold to HSBC Business Banking and they have told me repeatedly that my call is important to them, so I can't bear the thought of their disappointment if I hang up now.
@blesson_s We are not making appointments at branches because of the covid-19. May I ask what is the reason you would like to make an appointment? We can find other alternatives. Click on the link below to start DM, share your full name and post code too. ^Ank. https://t.co/OCvB5tjRBZ
@gompertz Yep, starling require a full business account which i have been declined for. HSBC allegedly allow feeder temporary accounts. Again if a full business account is required i will be declined. I'm eligible for the loan, but not to have a relationship with anyone offering it!
@HSBC_UK Afternoon. Just a quick one, am I able to still pop into a branch and pay some cash into my account? My local is Honiton. Thank you.
@andywacka Did you try Starling? HSBC still has to get you to open a business account i think which can take time
@willuminare gets a message from HSBC telling him when we drop below Â£50
"@Olga4Animals Clearly not the @HSBC who keep wibbling on about my payment not being received...
 
 I'm sending it. If the Post Office aren't delivering it that's not my fault..."
@EarthUncutTV @jjwalsh I miss HSBC in HK. You could convert currency between accounts, and then arrange to pick it up at a branch before your holiday. Not sure what itâ€™s like now, but they had tremendous service.
@TheLucyBShow @Bounce_BackLoan @StarlingBank I spoke to @hsbc earlier told me it's in the system might switch to @StarlingBank seem to look after their customers
@gompertz Would be interesting to see number unable to apply, like myself. I don't bank with any accredited lender. Only HSBC offer solution to non-customers. I applied for this last monday at midday, not a single word heard since
@HSBC_UK Iâ€™m trying to find details of my phone insurance
@HSBC_UK - can you help with the above please. I havenâ€™t received a response or log ins through the post. Surely going into branch isnâ€™t the only option?

@Bounce_BackLoan Update on HSBC business banking 11am Tuesday 12th. They have huge back logs and are now not even giving any time scale. They â€˜hope people will have ECHO sign emails by Friday but THEY WONT confirm application IDâ€™s or time scales and the loan team wonâ€™t take customer calls.
@HSBC_US Weâ€™ve been doing that for months. Weâ€™d need a refund and written statement that this is fraud + to fix the deep drop in credit scores that @HSBC_US insane treatment of this has caused. Technically you should pay double to compensate the time we already spent calling that number.

@HSBC_UK I've been a customer more than half my life but I am so beyond disappointed now. You've taken my cheque and despite waiting 2 months not given me the money. (I've chased and chased) at what point can I have my wages please?
@HSBC_UK Is there any exclusive events you guys have access to? With partners.
@DavzSingh Apart from theses you will receive communications (Letters in the post and to your inbox on your internet banking) for special promotions and offers. ^(1-2)^Thanoj
@HSBC_UK As it turns out, it's not getting sorted. We were told we'd get a call between 2 and 3 pm. By half 3, the wife has given up and rang back HSBC herself, only to be told that due to technical difficulties, your colleague can't get in touch with the cheque team and can we call back?
@HSBCUKBusiness been waiting 9 days for an update on an application for a bounce back loan and no one can tell me anything. Really poor show #hsbc
"@Mimirocah1 @MuellerSheWrote @glennkirschner2 @eliehonig @JoyceWhiteVance @BarbMcQuade Don't go overboard. He's a corporatist judge:
 
 In 2012 Judge Gleeson approved a deferred prosecution agreement with HSBC which was widely criticized as being too lenient.
 
 He then joined Debevoise &amp; Plimpton to practice white-collar crime defense.

@CryptoDutchy @JunkoSu22993224 @jpmorgan @HSBC can verify, junko is 100% fact.
@HSBC_UK I think this has got to be the worse bank to deal with. Applied to you for a business interruption loan 26th of March and still no money!!
@DelishDirection @HSBC_IN Seriously!! I was stunned too. Maybe itâ€™s another way to push Internet banking

@craig_removals @atag110 @HightonK @Bounce_BackLoan @ting_tong22 @LondonSME1 @ShannonCallag19 @jono5757a @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness @StarlingBank Congratulations @TideBusiness ðŸ‘ðŸ‘Š now how about approving those feeder accounts so we can apply. Please?
@petewall41 Is that from HSBC Peter? If so would you be ok to reply when you hear back as that would give a rough indication for those of us behind you in the queue?
HSBC'ers dont forget they have a deadline to make, you heard it here first. You are slowly but surely getting paid. https://t.co/pP5hz9hbNe
@alvin_d_hall chatting now with @RosalynConnors on #DriveTime @Gateway978 about new research from @HSBC_UK that suggests that some people are struggling to keep on top of their finances during the #coronavirusuk crisis. https://t.co/6bQvcLxyXn
@Joe87895908 @ting_tong22 @ShannonCallag19 @jono5757a @LondonSME1 @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness @StarlingBank No idea buddy. I'm just trying everything I can to open a feeder to be able to even apply for BBL. Far easier said than done.
@atag110 @craig_removals @HightonK @Bounce_BackLoan @PhilPelucha @LondonSME1 @ShannonCallag19 @jono5757a @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness @StarlingBank Still saying pre approval, looking at it now
Santander, Barclays and HSBC now offering you compensation. For over, in some cases, a week of stress and mental torture, You heard it here first! https://t.co/QpVqGbaOMn
@PhilPelucha @ting_tong22 @ShannonCallag19 @jono5757a @LondonSME1 @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness @StarlingBank Ah ok thatâ€™s where I was confused. I thought if Tide was offering the loans they would be shouting it from the roof tops. The account opening is pretty simple but Tide has mooted a credit line approach. Not sure how this will work.
"@GeorgeGammon Is HSBC the holder for $GLDM?
