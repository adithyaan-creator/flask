@HSBC_UK How do I get through to your mortgage people? I have tried on 3 seperate occasions, I will be out of my fixed term mortgage soon and am certainly not wanting to pay the SVR! Is there a complaint email address or number?
@HSBC My daughter received a text asking her to contact them within 5 days or her mortgage application would be rejected. She held for an hour and a half and still there was no reply. Can you suggest how she gets in touch?

Please please please @eddiemair @LBCNews can you get someone from @HSBC_UK to answer why they aren‚Äôt processing #bouncebackloans ? desperate for help. Applied 4may. Nothing. Can‚Äôt even tell us what‚Äôs happening.
Second day spending 4 hours on the line trying to get hold of @Barclays for the #bouncebackloan . Ridiculous service tbh. @HSBCUKBusiness hasn't been helpful at all either. Applied 2 weeks ago to HSBC and still no sign of any Correspondence.
Another stunning case of total and shocking disregard for customers by a major company. Hanging on the phone for 48 mins. It‚Äôs ok though the message I hear every minute is that ‚Äò we apologise for the delay and will be with me SHORTLY‚Äô. @HSBC_UK @hsbc #Banking #HSBC #TimeforChange
@rockbot I almost always get "invalid last name", a database error where it saves but I can't log in, a black square / garble on post / name badges (web design &amp; typography conferences!, @mozilla web standards meeting!) etc. @HSBC_UK form crashed 2 days ago without reason. It was the √≠.
@HSBC_IN Hi team, have been jumping around options to get myself registered for phone banking, but to no avail. Not able to get through customer care without that. Pls help

 Worst and pathetic service by you"
We're aware of an intermittent issue with HSBC, First Direct and M&amp;S endpoint connection. Connection attempts at this point to either of the providers might fail. We are sorry for the inconvenience and will keep you posted once the issue is resolved.
Absolutely appalled by customer service @BarclaysUK &amp; @BarclaysBizChat . 11 days waiting for a callback whilst my livelihood goes down the drain. Worst experience with any business in my life. Meanwhile other banks are coping fine. Would advise moving to HSBC OR Santander asap.
@HSBC_UAE I am extremely disappointed of your usual verification calls for money transfer. its become annoying of getting such calls every time for the amount not exceeding AED 10,000. just now I received call to verify AED 315/- has been transfer from my account !!!!!! https://t.co/ZZjNGBquI2
On Juneteenth I learned trillions of dollars have been laundered through the beloved #HSBC and our elected officials (U.S. DA) support this system by fining them a couple billion dollars every few years. 100,000+ deaths sponsored by HSBC. Opt out, buy #bitcoin !!
