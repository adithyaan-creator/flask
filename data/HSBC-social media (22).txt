@HSBC_UK phishing site for you to get rid of. I am not a customer of yours, but thought it best to report it to you https://t.co/nTHUrUNxA3
@HSBC_UK I also have another query. I made a purchase online for a desk from Wellindall on the 3rd. The mail response showed 4-7 days for delivery. They are not responding to my mails and there is no number to contact them on. Can I ask you to reverse the transaction on my card?
@OfficialSGorman @HSBC_UK Don't hold your breath. I switched to them and then switched away as soon as I could. The Mobile app is difficult to get into. I'm with TSB now and they're pretty good.
@HSBC_UK I have done all that over and over. I have even gone so far as to flush dns but the issue remains
@DefinitelyEddy @MattBombHead @StarlingBank I've used it for almost 3 years and it's now my main current account. Not a single problem in that time (after HSBC and TSB, both of which were diabolical).
@GaryBooysen @Barclays @HSBC @Investec @StandardBankZA @jpmorgan @AbsaSouthAfrica @BNPParibas @Nedbank @CreditSuisse 75 is my guess
@HSBC_UK There is no option on either Smile or Monzo to choose this and nothing pre-fills. All I want to do is to pay some money onto my HSBC credit card balance. I should be able to do this within my HBBC account. I can for every other credit card I own. Such a poor user experience.

@__darkfantasyy Not really. Ingxaki with irugby at the Olympics is that it's relatively no different from what we see already kwi HSBC world series ito results. I don't think it has that much of a pull to players as a series like the B&amp;I Lions does.

@HSBC_US Why do companies do this? Itâ€™s a personal digital strategy pet peeve of mine. Maybe you wanted a fresh start from the avalance of 1-star reviews the older app had? I donâ€™t know. Anyway, this app obviously didnâ€™t remember my ID or, sadly, password. (8/??)
Covid-19 is accelerating the digital disruption in banking. https://t.co/NSpdnI7xgn

@HSBC_US Hereâ€™s your first pro tip: if youâ€™re going to make me verify even the length of my fingernails, at least make it easy for me to use a password manager. Itâ€™s safer for both of us. (5/??)
@HSBC_US This time, surprisingly enough, I could not remember the PW since, of course, I had to set a new one pretty much each time I logged on. To boot, the site doesnâ€™t ask if you want iCloud to choose a pw or remember the pw you choose (4/??)

@AdamHirson That's ok. We're still looking at it. Though in some ways I worry its counterproductive. There's no recourse mechanism, and so the best move is to try elsewhere. I hear some have been accepted by HSBC who starling rejected.
@closetrevolut1 @samturn57422946 @Adam1717_ @Bounce_BackLoan Well if HSBC saying that (I hope they are) ... they completely changed their tune. ALL the contact I had was all about needing business / feeder - specifically told (often) would not use my c/a. Maybe they changed? They really donâ€™t know what they are doing!
@RockboltG @pixiesheena Tried closing 2 HSBC accounts with minimal amounts in,nigh on bloody impossible
@1_Pipster @samturn57422946 @Adam1717_ @Bounce_BackLoan Um I was told that personal current account holders can get the BBL, I own an LTD. HSBC's online applications asks specifically if you have a personal one and to provide details of that, you do not need a feeder unless you have no accounts with HSBC.
Quick update the mass emailing of the CEO of HSBC saw many people being paid today, if you havent done so and HSBC are messing you about, email the CEO asap, explain your worries.concerns and it will be addressed. someone post the email address saves me looking it up again.
@refill1000 @1_Pipster @Bounce_BackLoan @Adam1717_ @HSBC_UK maybe you can put the same effort you put into allowing cartels to launder billions of dollars into the feeders. Then weâ€™d all be paid by midnight.
"@og_tessa @declassifiedUK Oborne left the Telegraph because that wouldn't publish articles critical of HSBC, one of their biggest donors in terms of advertising.

@1_Pipster @refill1000 @Bounce_BackLoan @Adam1717_ Itâ€™s very misleading because option 3 is an option after all. Yet this poor guy has used it, waited 16 days to be told needs a feeder. @HSBC_UK take the fucking option away and set up an auto reply for everyone whoâ€™s used it. MORONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hearing hsbc declining personal account holders/sole traders because they arenâ€™t business customers and/or didnâ€™t start trading through current account before April 2019. so if you arenâ€™t one of those two expect the same BS email after weeks of waiting! @Bounce_BackLoan
@Bounce_BackLoan Iâ€™ve seen an email as before this I thought would be fine regardless. I believe hsbc may have updated this recently as a restriction to either catch up on existing back log or to top up liquidity? god knows but itâ€™s shit!

"@samturn57422946 @Adam1717_ @Bounce_BackLoan To be honest. It would be a very odd move to decline people all at once. I know starling did, but hsbc surely would not open someones application then put it to the side instead of authorising it without declining.

@Bounce_BackLoan @samturn57422946 @Adam1717_ Thatâ€™s as maybe. If it has happened it is either an error or it has come via a feeder account. The rules are, because it is a business based loan it must go into a business account or a feeder account. I have had a current account with HSBC for 32 years and canâ€™t use it for BBL.
@Bounce_BackLoan @1_Pipster @Adam1717_ To be honest, hsbc have the option there as one of 4 options. Option 4 means you have to take a feeder account. These are only starting to appear now yet Iâ€™ve seen on the thread a lot of people saying been paid as a sole trader and current account.

@madds_f There may be some useful info here: https://t.co/eYV9Nfo2N8 I had some money taken last year from and HSBC refunded straight away and then investigated to check it actually was fraud (which it was). Write to the bank and say youâ€™ll refer to FCA or financial ombudsman.
@CBCAlerts If the prosecution's only argument is that HSBC would be taking a risk "by providing finance to a company on the wrong side of U.S. law," then I don't think they have a leg to stand on.

@HSBC_UK applied for basic bank account online. Asked to take ID in branch and was told theyâ€™d set the acct up and my mobile banking. Got there, all they did was upload the ID. Can you chase my application up so my acct can be used please? Really unhappy
@HSBC @HSBC_UK @HSBC_Sport @HSBC_IN i am tired of trying customer support and seems it doesnâ€™t have my record. I had been charged for last 3 months some extra charges which were never the case. Would like the closure of my card as I am tired of paying those.
@1_streets Hi Martin. At this stage you'll have to be verified in branch, no other options I'm afraid for security reasons. I'm sorry for any inconvenience but this is to safeguard your accounts. ^RIT

@HSBC_US Ok, Will call you today. I tried chatting twice yesterday, but wasnâ€™t helpful!
@CraigLe25711685 @Bounce_BackLoan @StarlingBank @BritishBBank I agree, and itâ€™s very easy once youâ€™ve been paid to take a reflective look, but thatâ€™s what I did. Take HSBC for example, they had over a years worth of applications in one week, I know my business couldnâ€™t deal with a year of custom in one week.
@Gagsahota Hello There, have you tried try to use a different browser by any chance ? ^ZAR
@SaraWil11201639 @HSBC_UK Their conclusion will almost certainly not be in your favour, because they or the credit card company do not want to pay out billions for cancelled holidays. Therefore your most fruitful route will be the Small Claims Court.
HSBC &amp; StanChart both fall on China / Hong Kong worries. HSBC lowest since 2009 and Standard Chartered lowest since 1998. Most of the top HK jobs will move to other parts of Asia if China keeps screwing up.....and most likely many will move to Singapore.. https://t.co/Q24xvK914L

@SaraWil11201639 @HSBC_UK @HSBC_UK will almost certainly take at least 8 wks to respond to your query, but most likely will drag this out for many months to tire out claimants in the hope that they will drop their claim.

HSBC have been playing catch up. They paid lots of people yesterday, many who had emailed the CEO. They have, fair play to them also been phoning people up and setting up Feeder Accounts, but you can not yet apply for a BBL with such an account. People still waiting for payments.

 I just feel like I'm playing deal or no deal, and shouldn't have revised my amount. 
 Hsbc advised to do so if it was still under 1/4 of my turnover with worries of a second wave/lockdown."
@michaelblackcab @IllLeaveMyMark @santanderukhelp @Bounce_BackLoan HSBC donâ€™t take online applications. You have to call to register and wait for a call back. Iâ€™m still waiting after 1 week. Lloydâ€™s not taking anymore applications now either. Fml ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¼â€â™‚ï¸

@HSBC_UK @NatWest_Help What is the best way to get rid of these gadgets? Can you advise please.
@Sallysalster @virginmedia Fuckers. I once got cut off by HSBC telephone banking because I couldn't remember if my standing order I wanted to cancel ended in 37p or 73p. While I was standing in a branch where they had refused to do it at the counter and sent me to a phone on the wall. Useless.
@HSBC_UK I need to claim my money back in a trans from 9th Dec where I have cancelled car rental but my refund has not been paid back. I have tried the company, HSBC website and chat but not getting through. @GreenMotion Â£355.90.
@HSBC how many passwords do I actually have to remember for my online banking? Seriously you might as well hand me a safe and ask me to crack it in order to access my account. Absolutely ridiculous.
Iâ€™m so annoyed walked all this way to the bank before it closes! Why is it closed when it says 2pm.. not 1.30pm @HSBC_UK #Scarborough
@HSBC_UK 2 hours trying to speak to a human at Hsbc to report fraudulent transactions has failed. I will take my businesses to Santander after the bank holiday weekend. I will not be liable for anything else that gets appplied to my card or accounts.

"@Bounce_BackLoan Has anybody else got the BBL account set up in their business account, but no sight of the Echo sign document? 
 Had the account with the pending balance for 5 days now but HSBC yet to send me echo sign"
@HSBC_IN Thanks. You will receive an email from Uttara Kumari Singh who is a customer of HSBC and been trying to reach your customer care for over 2 weeks. This was on her behalf. Thanks for the response.
@HSBC_UK I thought that would be the case, the managing it online once opened is the winning part of it. I'll pop to a branch at sdome point soon. Thank you for the reply.
@hmtreasury @RishiSunak 2 questions and please answer them Q1 why are HSBC so bad when it comes to sorting out BBL to customers people applied on day 1 and still havenâ€™t heard anything Q2 why did you choose the cut off for furloughs on LTD companyâ€™s as most MDs who just employ themselves canâ€™t apply
HSBC Feeder Account - Got some followers that have been able to have them remotely set up for them with a shared screen, it takes 30 mins - 1 hour to have them done, which leads me to believe they will be live soon. No one I know of has applied for and been paid a bbl by one yet

@HSBC_UK Thanks for the quick reply. Is there a way to transfer some of the funds into say premium bonds if it cannot be done on the app?
@HSBCUKBusiness I made my application on the 7th and have yet to receive my echosign. Judging by some other comments on this thread it could be a long wait for the funds even after I get it (whenever that may be) I will probably be out of business by then... thanks for nothing HSBC.

"@DarthGore @HSBC_UK Yeah, daughter had same issue. Over a week with online access after she had switched from elsewhere. No wonder she switched away within a month. Still, the Â£175 incentive each almost made it worth the hassle. 
 
 Almost."
#AskRishi Dear Chancellor, Why HSBC have taken so long to release BBL funds despite application accepted and loan documents signed two weeks ago. Can you talk to HSBC as this is your Government backed loan arrangement for thie unprecedented time of Covid-19.
@DarthGore @phil_66 @HSBC_UK Dont worry I have been waiting since march to switch. Switch happened weeks ago and now cant even access my own money as I haven't received a pin and they cant discuss it because I haven't had my telephone banking stuff through to verify my account. Worse switch ever.
@HSBC Why can't hsbc uae give statements in Excel format or Text format. Is it a technical issue for your IT teams.
@santanderukhelp Thanks for helping. I calmed and spoke to Bradley Darren who was just as helpful with providing me all the answers I needed answering today. So much so that I am now seeking to move banks (from HSBC) to you guys.

@kbw170 Good Afternoon. The only way to open this type of account is by visiting a branch .Youâ€™ll just need to bring some identification and proof of your address. Once your account is open, you can manage it in branch and online. I hope this helped! â˜ºï¸ ^DOM
@HSBCUKBusiness All other major Banks have sanctioned BBL and made funds available for use already. Mine application was accepted and documents e-signed 2 weeks ago. No communication update from HSBC. Too much of stress on this unprecedented time.
