@nowtponcy @HSBC @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness Hiya!! I applied to @HSBC as thatâ€™s who my business bank account is with and thought it would speed up the process, how wrong I was. Almost 3 weeks in and Iâ€™m still waiting. My peers have had theirs from @NatWestBusiness @RBS and @BarclaysBizChat ðŸ˜¢
@Pickles5012 @HSBC @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness Hey, do you have to go with your existing bank?
Are you listening @HSBC @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness? As a #SmallBusiness the #government #bouncebounce loan was the lifeline I needed so why do long to get it? #answerme #whyamiwaiting #stillwaiting #nonews #helpsavesmallbusinesses #CustomerService #customerfirst

@Bounce_BackLoan hi guy's any suggestions or help I've applied on the 13th of May with HSBC called a couple of times but still nothing no correspondent what so ever how do I make a complaint ?? Thanks..

"@HSBC_UK any reason I was charged a non sterling fee? Is that to discourage international trade? What happened to â€˜We are not an islandâ€™?
 
 I knew I should of used my @monzo"
@Jason I remember only a few years ago HSBC threatening to move its HQ from the U.K. for Hong Kong if it got taxed or regulated too much.
@Bounce_BackLoan Have we heard of any HSBC Feeder accounts being paid yet, or will they be done after HSBCâ€™s normal customers?
What a horrible bank @HSBC is. To review old statements they recommend going in person to a branch amid this crisis. What a f'n joke! #bankwithcanadianbanks
@Bounce_BackLoan I have to say Hsbc are now trying to get there act together good for you
@olimorts46 @justleeuk @HSBC_UK Iâ€™m not sure your bank should hold your tax details unless you sent them in voluntarily?

@Bounce_BackLoan No. Only done the forms no account yet. Donâ€™t get me wrong they might still let me down however I am a non customer so appreciate them trying for me. I personally feel other banks are putting pressure on HSBC by not taking some of the work off them
@1_Pipster @HSBC_UK Itâ€™s a nightmare, the first person I spoke to had no idea what I meant, an hour and a half after phoning they told me to phone someone else. They put me back on to the first number. Every time I think I should be loyal to them they let me down ðŸ™ˆ

@simonbrenner8 @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC @BarclaysUKHelp @BarclaysUK @Bounce_BackLoan Did you already had a personal account with HSBC?
@HSBC_UK Not much of a telephone banking service if they cannot assist your customers. The overdraft was caused by a company taking two payments in error. They have compensated me for a charge incurred from another company but the fact remains there is no customer service or support.
Well didnâ€™t expect that on a Sunday @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC have called and are trying to help while my business account @BarclaysUKHelp @BarclaysUK havenâ€™t even tried ! @Bounce_BackLoan
Iâ€™d very much like to know how @HSBC_FR charged me 25 euros for some money sent to me from Sweden. And they havenâ€™t done anything. 25 euros for nothing. Should have used my British bank account, wouldnâ€™t have been charged at all. Iâ€™ll change banks, theyâ€™re awful.

 I done mine Thursday night (ceo).
 Got a response half way through Friday saying she has started on it and will update me. 
 
 So I'm assuming you will get contact tuesday when they are back. 
 
 I would also say as you have signed you should be like the people ..."
@CancelShaw @FSCS @HSBC_UK Evidence of 2 cancellations and have reported them to HSBC and PayPal. If they try to charge me again (impossible through PayPal now) I'm taking it further.
@CancelShaw @FSCS @HSBC_UK They said they can't stop pending transactions, but when it is debited to contact them and they will start a case. I actually was charged through PayPal, so I stopped all future payments and started a case. I am calling Shaw Academy to finally cancel and tell them I have evidence

@ilovelockdown @HSBC_UK Yeah of course, we must view it holistically. But at the end of the day, it is Israel who are in the wrong and caused the issues and the rebellion. If someone started taking over your front room, youâ€™d rebel against it because itâ€™s your front room- just like the land is theirs.
@HSBC_UK pretty sure we are mate https://t.co/WrYNKp0UGF

@Kharndrake1 @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBC And know that you have done everything you can to make this happen - the fact that the CEO has responded to you is a big plus - I haven't had that! So it sounds as though things will move for you this week
@Kharndrake1 @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBC It really is a roller coaster situation, and there will be many business owners like me that will really consider their future banking with @HSBCUKBusiness after this fiasco quietens down

@Kharndrake1 @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBC I think youâ€™ll be ok as long as you stayed within the 25% - theyâ€™ve got your details so even with the 2 applications, they should link them together. Weâ€™re you asking for the same amount on both applications?

@HSBC_IN Ritesh, whats the update? Why do i need to follow up again? U r supposed to update me by last week only. Call me asap.
@StarlingBank @JimboCrypto This is not right... HSBC paid out to a ltd co and itâ€™s parent company that I know of. @StarlingBank are acting different to other banks. If not changing its interpretation then time to move banks unfortunately.

HSBC 9/9: But as we enter a deep recession with only a lumbering recovery thereafter, structural forces are likely to weigh more heavily on #GBP. We therefore see #GBPUSD falling in 2020, before a very modest rebound in 2021.
HSBC 8/9: Previously, when it looked like cyclical forces (such as interest rate differentials) would dominate FX, we believed that investors would happily overlook these structural risks.
HSBC 7/9: weakness as the currency has been cheaper in the past. Long-term measures of fair value are also gradually declining, which could reflect slower growth, weaker productivity or an inability to close the current account deficit.
"HSBC 6/9: and a comprehensive free-trade agreement might be difficult to agree before the end of 2020. If no agreement is reached, #GBP may weaken to reflect greater trade and investment frictions.

"HSBC 4/9: the UK to finance a slow, drawn-out economic recovery than other countries with better fiscal positions, such as Australia and New Zealand.
 
 - Large external liabilities: These create the risk of outflows from foreign investors selling UK assets."
"HSBC 3/9: sizable external financing. We think these factors, along with ongoing Brexit risks,will weigh on #GBP this year.
 
 - The UK's fiscal dynamics: These leave GBP much more at risk than many other G10 currencies. The starting point of high debt-to-GDP may make it harder for"
"HSBC 2/9: such as relative fiscal positions, as a key driver of #FX. We expect those currencies whose governments have more fiscal room to support their economies to outperform.
