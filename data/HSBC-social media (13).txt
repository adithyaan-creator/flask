@ClarkiiStomias @LukeGromen @MacleodFinance The APs usually deliver gold to the Trust (GLD) from their accounts at HSBC, and receive baskets of GLD shares in return. The question is why AP(s) delivered gold to the Trust at the Bank of England. Was there no gold available at the HSBC vault for APs to use? It looks that way.

@ClarkiiStomias @LukeGromen @MacleodFinance The 10Q doesnâ€™t say that, it says that 45.91 tonnes of gold (bars) at the BoE represented about 4.4% of the GLD (Trust) assets. If 45.91 tonnes = 4.4%, then 100% = 1043.4 tonnes (the full holding). The rest, 95.6 tonnes, is claimed to be in the HSBC vault.
@HSBC_UK please can you help . Applied for bounce back loan as a non current customer a week ago .supposed to be opening us a temporary account but we have not heard back. Who do we need to call please?
@whitecarz @Bounce_BackLoan Did you receive an email confirming receipt of your application? Like you, I applied early Monday &amp; didnâ€™t hear a thing - now lead to believe that HSBC are saying no email confirmation = itâ€™s not in system, so Iâ€™ve re-applied
@HSBC_UK why cant I raise a complaint on the website or app?
@HSBCUKBusiness We applied on 4th May and have a copy of the application but havenâ€™t heard back from HSBC.we called today and were told if we didnâ€™t Re Iâ€™ve an email then the online application hasnâ€™t been received by HSBC but we have a copy of rhe application??

@AshJw86 @RobbHughes @HSBC_UK Well i still havenâ€™t received a call or a response to the email you must be a preferred customer. Did apply for the 3rd time this morning using different email address (non-google) and chrome and did get email after submitting. Back of the queue now

HSBC: All in all, we think that the dominance of the #RORO phenomenon and possibly #Brexit headlines will likely bring more volatility to the #GBP in the near term.
"HSBC 6/6: with the large economy of the Eurozone. As such, #GBP is likely to struggle in a `risk-off environment, in our view.
 
 All in all, we think that the dominance of the #RORO phenomenon and possibly Brexit headlines will likely bring more volatility to #GBP in the near term"
HSBC 5/6: More importantly, the 'Risk On-Risk Off (#RORO) phenomenon (i.e., risk appetite) is likely to remain the dominant near-term driver for the FX market. The GBP has moved into the frisk-on' bucket, possibly because of Brexit and the UK economy's gradually softening ties
HSBC 4/6: As the UK economy begins its lockdown exit programme, most likely later this month, the GBP may spend more energy contemplating a different exit. As the possibility of a hard Brexit cannot completely be ruled out, a focus on Brexit might weigh on the #GBP.
HSBC 3/6: Instead, #Brexit could regain its potency as a near-term driver, in our view. So far, the UK government continues to insist that it will not ask for an extension of the Brexit transition period, deadline for such a request looming increasingly close at the end of June.
"HSBC 1/6: think the door is open to more quantitative easing (QE).
 In our view, central bank policy is not a differentiating factor for the GBP, as G10 central bankers dragged policy to the lower bound and introduced unconventional policy support programmes."
HSBC 1/6: On 7 May, #BOE# #MPC voted unanimously to keep its policy rate on hold at 0.10%, which was in line with consensus expectations. MPC Members voted by 7-2 to keep asset purchases unchanged at GBP645bn... With downside risks to inflation and the split vote, our economists

HSBC: In the US, headline CPI inflation is pencilled in to fall to 0.4% yoy in April, weighed down by plunging gasoline prices. Removing volatile energy and food components, core CPI is expected to slow 0.4ppts to 1.7% yoy, which would be the lowest reading in more than two years

@HSBC_AUS I have downloaded the new banking app. There seems to be less functionality than the old app. E.g I am unable to view a statement from the app. Is that correct?
@CullimoreDenise @JennieKnowles15 It sounds as if you're talking about the Bounce Back loan, rather than SEISS? since SEISS applications are not open until tomorrow earliest. HSBC are slow because they were the only lender open to non-customers - they had 12,800 applications in the first 6 hours, so overwhelmed.
