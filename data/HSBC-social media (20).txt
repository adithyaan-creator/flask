@CraigDamon13 @colincftaylor @loveholidays You have 120 days from when service should be delivered to start chargeback process. So 120 days from date of departure. Banks highly variable in response @HSBC_UK rubbish, Lloyd's and Barclays much better

@MrLeeArthur I and others have sent evidence bundles to Corbyn exposing serious bank fraud. From my part Deutsche Banks manipulation of precious metals, for others the HSBC Swiss money laundering scandal...and Corbyn did nothing. Check my pin, the cross party TSC covers up a paedophile ring.

@HSBC_UK hi, no agent is responding on the app?
@HSBC_IN I need to escalate this matter.i already asked your team not to issue me new card due to lockdown I am not available at my address.this information is also captured in your records.then why did your team issue new card
@haventberoy Hey, absolutely HKD has huge negative exposure to China and especially the HSBC which in my view is going to get in trouble in next 3 years. The peg will likely either fail or it will come under huge pressure, as China / US cold war escalates, the HK stands to lose the most.

@HSBC_UK please let all your customers know that the money they think is theirs and they think they can withdraw at any time can be held onto by HSBC apparently indefinitely if HSBC decides to "review" the account and freeze the money. This happens to innocent customers.
Hey @HSBC_UK last time I looked we were an island. #justsaying
"@HSBC_UK @Moneybox
 @MartinSLewis @paullewismoney
 how long can you freeze an account for ? Well under POCA you need a court order and oversight by a judge. But if HSBC is just ""reviewing"" an account...all the judicial protections for the individual built into POCA don't apply!!!"
@HSBC_UK It has taken you over two months to even apologise for breaking the law in a way that has put my personal safety at risk.
"@HSBC_UK @Moneybox
 @paullewismoney @MartinSLewis
 Here's another example ...but at least his account wasn't frozen for ten months...ten months and still no end in sight. How does this happen in a civilised country???

@HSBC_UK Is there a Â£100 incentive for opening a student account with you? There is according to other sites but it isnâ€™t mentioned on your website at all! Thanks ...
@ZaffarA49487078 @canarabank @HSBC_IN ðŸ¤£ They new the answer irrespective of questions
@HSBC_UK I realise laundering money for Mexican drug cartels got HSBC into trouble but that's no excuse for persecuting innocent customers and depriving them of their live savings. Your "account reviews" are a disgusting misuse of your position. There is no excuse.

@HSBC_UK There is no point discussing this with you. Nobody at HSBC listens why should someone who monitors the Twitter feed be any different? Maybe Ian Stuart will listen.
@HSBC_UK Thank you very much.
@Ioverofcalum Tex HSBC orbit limb
@HSBC_UK how many other innocent people are suffering because you refuse to listen and freeze their accounts indefinitely with no justification? This could happen to any of your customers. People think "no smoke without fire" until it happens to them! The press will expose this.
@HSBC_UK That's funny, because I called your customer services and they said someone from the branch would call me. Which of course they never did.
@sally_chamness @Bounce_BackLoan @TideBusiness Do it! If I ever hear back from HSBC then Iâ€™ll do it
@HSBC_UK @MartinSLewis @Moneybox @paullewismoney the only way to get HSBC to do anything is by bringing the matter to the press's attention. This could happen to any of HSBC's customers. People need to know.

@HSBC_UK Please make people aware that it's not just money launderers who have their accounts frozen by you....innocent people do too! at least POCA account freezes (ultimately) have to be authorised by the courts. When HSBC "review" an account they can freeze it as long as they like!
@HSBC_UK Or...what number do I call?
@HSBC_UK Thank you. How do I access the live chat?

@HSBC_UK people think banks only freeze accounts of guilty people. No smoke without fire they say. When this happens to you, you will realise this is not true. Be aware that they can freeze your account at any time and deny you access to your money and there's nothing you can do

"@MSQ_LIF3 Hi there. We are very sorry for the delay. We have received thousands of applications from business customers for bounce back loans.
 We are working through them as quickly as possible and will contact all those who have applied in the coming days. ^DOM"
@Lozz410 Thanks ðŸ™‚, one way around this is to save the email to your device and then email it to yourself. Please leave us some feedback around this here: https://t.co/qSatda8HcZ its great to get it as we use it to constantly improve our service to you. Thank you! ^Alison.
@HSBC_UK it is impossible to get anyone at HSBC to listen and see sense. Once they "review" your account you have no access to your money for months (maybe years) and nothing you say makes any difference. The ombudsman doesn't get involved in reviews. #itcouldhappentoyou
@SaraWil11201639 I'm sorry for any misunderstanding. If live chat have advised you to call the disputes team, then the information isn't readily available to them. The best thing to do is to call us on 03457 404 404, the disputes team will be open 8am-6pm Monday-Friday. ^Serena
@hsbc yes Voss we are an island #brexit
@HSBC_UK I agree. Clapping on Thursdays should be for more than those who work on the medical side of life in hospitals not that we shouldnâ€™t be grateful for them too x
@susiebluesky Ok, I can see if I can figure this out for you without locking you out ðŸ™‚ when you log onto your iPad are you generating a code from your phone? Or just using fingerprint or Digital password? ^Alison.
@HSBC_UK I'm sure if more customers/potential were made aware of your kafka-esque "account reviews" and "inhibits"(aka account freezes) fewer people would deposit money with you.

@HSBC_UK people think banks only freeze the accounts of fraudsters. They can and do freeze the accounts of innocent people. And when they do there is no way of getting through to them, you are stuck in a nightmare. Ten months so far. And no end in sight.#Itcouldhappentoyou

@Bounce_BackLoan after emailing the hsbc ceo 2 days ago i now have had 3 different emails from 3 different case handlers for a call back on tuesday..more the merrier?
@HSBC_UK and there appear to be no limits on how long they can review (aka freeze) your account. Make sure you have another bank account in case it happens to you. It can happen to anyone. You wouldn't believe this could happen but it does. There is nothing you can do about it! https://t.co/lekggcM5vt
@HSBC_UK be aware that when you deposit money with HSBC it can place your account under review at any time. It can also freeze the money in your account and refuse to give it back. Think this doesn't happen to innocent people? This has been happening for ten months so far!
Has anyone had an easier/quicker experience with HSBC feeder account for the bounce back loan?? @HSBC_UK #bouncebackloans #bouncebackloan #help
@paullewismoney are you aware @HSBC_UK is freezing innocent people's accounts for ten months and refusing them access to their money? There is no way to resolve this. The ombudsman doesn't get involved with a "review" HSBC seem to be able to review/ freeze accounts indefinitely
@S_ncww hi hsbc will offer you a bbl it takes a few week to set up but they do come through they will set a feeder account up for you

@HSBC Peace be upon you, my father, contact HSBC
@HSBC_UK Thank you, you too! ðŸ™ðŸ½
@HSBC_UK please tell customers that when they deposit money with you, you can decide not to pay it back to them if you put their account in "review". This gives you the right to refuse to repay it until you decide to finish your "review" and there is nothing the customer can do

So fun story. I don't have a car and none of the banks within walking distance of me are open except an @HSBC branch because of the pandemic, but HSBC told me they wouldn't exchange cash for coins so I could do my laundry because I'm not a member.
@HSBC_UK once you deposit money with HSBC they can refuse to repay it to you if they are carrying out a "review" of your account. The length of time this "review" can continue is indefinite. Which effectively means they freeze (hand onto) your money and won't give it back to you.

@HSBC_UK be aware that HSBC can place your account under review at any time. This means they can freeze it and not allow you to withdraw your money for a very long time. This doesn't just happen to "dodgy" people. It happens to innocent people! #itcouldhappentoyou

@HSBC_UK my account got logged out from my mobile banking and it got logged. Now I canâ€™t sign in. I have emailed it to ukhelp@hsbc.com but still havenâ€™t heard anything back.
@HSBCUKBusiness @HSBCUKBusiness Applied BBL 6th May, signed it on 13th May, HSBC got acc no wrong, got a call stating that these wrong forms would be worked on before processing any new BBL's &amp; that we would get an amended form to sign. Nearly 2 weeks later we are still waiting? Why?

@iliamizani94 However, if you need to check the pending payments you can call through to us on 03457 404404 so that we can check and let you know. (2/2) ^Sam
@iliamizani94 Hi there, if it was a card payment it has to go through an authorisation process where it needs to be authorised by visa/master card &amp; finally claimed by the merchant for the payment to be reflected on the account, so we do not have any control over it I'm afraid (1/2) ^Sam
