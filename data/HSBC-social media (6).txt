@HSBC_UK trying to get access to my old account and the customer service advisor, sorry robot, is just repeating the same thing to me that they canâ€™t help....no reason why....very difficult, Unhelpful and I want to do is access an account. Can I ask for someone to be in touch!
@WilliamClouston @WilliamClouston EU financial services regulation has been at the heart of groups like HSBC and Pru UK considering reheadquartering to Asia. We need to nurture our crown jewel businesses in a post EU world &amp; re-examine the competitiveness of our financial services capital regimes
@HSBC So my wife and I applied for savings accounts with HSBC US. Iâ€™m a current direct checking customer my wife isnâ€™t. She gets immediately approved while I have to wait 3-4 days (as an existing customer). #@ssbackwards!

@HSBC why canâ€™t I access my online account and why hasnâ€™t a transaction still not arrived 3 hours later. On hold for 1 hour on the phone ??
hsbc has suspended my online banking because I made Â£3000 worth of deposits into smarkets and betfair. then because I don't remember a memorable word that I put on the account 6 years ago I have to go into the branch to unlock my account. great stuff
Be careful transferring any significant amounts of money to @RevolutApp. They can just freeze your account and not be in contact at all and thereâ€™s nothing you can do. Sometimes @HSBC_UK and @Barclays are the best options

@BroknHeadphones @Amex I rang HSBC today as they charged me Â£40 interest after I had to furlough myself and was awaiting a payment. They immediately reimbursed my account. Nice but why charge in the first place unless you know many people won't query it. They could've just not charged anyone that month

Hsbc lost 200m a day for almost two weeks shorting gold. Why are they shorting gold? So China can acquire for cheap. Im not blaming. JP morgan was fined for manipulating resources too. Sheds light, BMO couldnt cover shorts on gold stocks this AM so they somehow manipulated stocks

@DailyMirror Iâ€™m wondering if you are interested in my story. Basically HSBC have taken money (2k) out of my account without my authorisation and are now trying to fob me off with a basic apology. Please let me know.
Barclays â€“ 1.5 lak cror. HSBC India â€“ 2 lak cror. Care Rating â€“ 2.73 lak cror. Est of various org about the actual amount the govt is going to spend from the 20 lakh crore package. Which is around 1% of the GDP and not 10% #Lockdownextention #reliefpackage #IndiaFightsCOVID19

@HSBC_UK OK thanks. This is a charitable donation to India, the NGO is FCRA approved, so there should be no issue? Is there a field to complete the FCRA number when doing an online transaction? Also, you've gained a new customer - you top trump every other bank so far on your intl. fees!
@HSBCUKBusiness My business, Armone Ltd, is in serious danger of going under now. Can someone come back to me? I think waiting for over 15 days is sufficient specially as I had CBILS approved and was told to switch to BBLS. Is anyone in HSBC able to help, I have been with you for 7 years!

@RoksAnnRoschana Hey, Roks-Ann! If you were to make the transfer online it is Â£4, over the phone/branch it's Â£9. If you were transferring to HSBC account in India we would not be applying any fees.

@Bounce_BackLoan so I have a Barclays phone call to onboard on the 4th June and hsbc feeder account email asking if I wish to stay on list. Does saying yes to hsbc mean I have an application in progress which will scupper Barclays? Should I say take me off the hsbc list...
