I have been a customer with HSBC for over 20 years, and the service I have got is beyond appalling. I have been waiting for over 18 weeks for my business account to be opened, I have been promised week after week that it will be open next week, so I have waited. I have a time sensitive grant that will run out next week, which I need for my business and has to be put into a business account. I am having to do all the extra work of managing business finances in my current account so it doesn’t get mixed up. No one is giving me any clear answers. You have pushed my business to the edge.
I feel infuriated with HSBC right now. I’ve been trying to open back accounts for my 2 older children. I have banked with you for many years and my family have worked for you, so I’m loyally trying time keep with you. However I’ve now tried for 6 weeks to open accounts for the children. I’ve had 3 different messages on phone, originally telling me I could now apply online, then no, then to make an appointment, then no. Now your new opening hours mean I actually can’t get them to the bank as you are open for school hours. Very frustrating.
"I applied for a bounce back loan in June still waiting now !!!! Complained and all hsbc have said is due to high volume they will be in contact don’t know where to go and I have banked with them for over 30 years !!! 
 
 Very poor service"
The worst bank in UK , change from HSBC trust me they never accept nothing even tou had many years ...
"Complaint 
 Hi ,WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it’s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar"
I’ve been offered a business overdraft which I do not want. Have been on hold for over an hour and slowly giving up hope of speaking to anyone. There’s no way of knowing whether I’m next in the queue or have 100’s of people in front of me. All I want to do is reject the overdraft as I know HSBC will charge me for this!!! Really bad show
mmmm I was considering switching but have had no reply to a question I sent on messenger. After reading some of these comments not sure if I will..... I thought HSBC had a good reputation ????
TG I got a pre lockdown appointment with Barclays son can close my accounts with HSBC...and open new one....HSBC fraud department admits they have made a mistake but only the dispute department can reverse the transaction...but they cant get hold of them....I have spent 5 hours on hold waiting for despute team to answer....they dont because they dont exist....
"HSBC A DISPUTE WAS OPEN IN MAY AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. THE PAYMENT WAS MADE ON A CREDIT CARD BY LAW MY REFUND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROCESSED BY NOW. 
 YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DISGUSTING"
@HSBC beyond all reasoning now!! 4 time my husband has tried to call, each time 2 hours getting through!!!! Twice got through! Twice put on hold but actually hung up on!!! This is not acceptable 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 8 hours in total and nothing is done!!!
HSBC currently due to lockdown to wait and reach the operators from abroad is expensive. So, it would be beneficial if we can arrange a direct call with the operator and then catch up. Otherwise to wait 15-20 minutes is impossible by international calls.
"Four times I phoned your dispute team on Monday 1st time waited 50 minutes, 2nd 20 minutes then another 50 minutes finally was answered only to be told that it was not the dispute department even though that was the number they asked me to phone. Young lady tried to help then put me on hold for the dispute department after a hour and 15 minutes gave up. 
 Got through yesterday was answered in 50 minutes went through my dispute sent paperwork while on phone and was told they would phone be back today(was on phone just over an hour). Phoned me back today told she couldn’t help me put me on hold for dispute team after over an hour come back and told me to phone another number have asked them to phone me back but not expecting them to just want my money back never mind giving new customers £125 this customer will be moving on after 34 years with HSBC."
"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November. Consequently I have this week spent a total of 6 hours and 10 minutes in phone calls with Barclaycard over a 4 day perios who have also confirmed the information given by HSBC was inaccurate. Subsequently I have once again this afternoon phoned HSBC only to be CUT OFF for the second time after forty minutes. 
 
 This has now left me with no other option than to contact:
 1: The financial ombudsman 
 2. BBC Watchdog
 3: A researcher I know personally who works for a well known TV show that exposes and brings to public attention situations like this.
 
 It's absolutely astounding that all I wanted to do was make a simple balance transfer! 
 
 If you are going to employ cheap monkeys to operate a business, you can expect to turn into a zoo, which judging by the reviews here, you've succeeded. 
 
 Absolutely appalling service."
HSBC Bloody useless bank! Ignore these supposedly positive posts, I cannot understand how unresponsive they are, don't deserve to be in business considering the way they treat, or, rather ignore their customers. Been waiting nearly 13 weeks for bounce back loan, chased sign-off docs, signed them three weeks ago, was told money would be in account within 48 hours, still nothing! AND that is after chasing it up upteen times, Bank Manager been on the case for last almost 2 weeks, he's getting no-where, apparently. Anyone thinking of joining this bank should think twice, as I know lots of people leaving it! I have been with the bank for 35 years, when it was Midland Bank, since becoming HSBC, it has slowly gone down hill to an incompetent mess!
Well HSBC are you really helping people and businesses out? I applied for my bounce back loan over 2 months ago, wrote multiple emails, spent hours on the phone and still nothing! You are letting small business to fail in these difficult times! Every other week I get the same answer to check my emails, but nothing is happening!

I am not having a good experience setting up my new HSBC account and registering on-line. I want to register so I can start to invest money in my new current account and also one or more savings accounts and I have no telephone security number which I must have to proceed. Visited a branch and was told it would be posted to me, and nothing has arrived, phoned the number advertised on your website several times, which is not a good experience and expensive, and twice spoke to an agent who said it had been posted, and still nothing has arrived. I am starting to think I have made a mistake in starting the switching process and I must say your customer service could and should be improved.
"25 minutes on the phone to some GUY I can barely understand
 Locked out of online banking
 Locked out of telephone
 EVEN AFTER 25 minutes NO PROGRESS
 THEN HE CUTS ME OFFTHE LINE
 YOU COULD NOT MAKE IT UP
 Take your money elsewhere and save the heartache
 HSBC you are a JOKE!!"
HSBC your customer service is an absolute shambles. I have been waiting over 10 weeks for a response and still nothing. What a joke
HSBC suddenly switches to 'right on' black rights when it suits there marketing strategy..... YUK
"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.
 
 Got through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!
 
 HSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.

Barclays. HSBC. Come tomorrow, Friday 24th July it is law to wear a face covering in shops, banks and post offices etc. Now for ID purposes, bank staff may ask a person to remove their face covering. Given such, will you be asking those wearing a burka to remove their face coverings for ID purposes, given that such is not a religious item of clothing? Equality must play a part of course.
Together against fraud? HSBC allows it and then does nothing to rectify it! I will be moving my accounts when all of this is resolved, that’s if it ever is!
I also bank with Lloyds, Nationwide and Santander - and I can honestly say HSBC is the SLOWEST and POOREST customer service. I have been waiting for a bounceback loan to come through for a very long time, no word, no email, no letters - totally unnacceptable. This is a government scheme and the bank should sort this out as a matter of priority. Why does it take 2 hours for someone to answer the phone, and when they do they don't know how to help?? The lockdown excuse is wearing thin now. Most people are back at work! Terrible.
HSBC my wife tried to log on to business banking as usual on Sunday but it was immediately rejected saying that there were too many failed attempts. She followed the process including printing a form, completing it, taking a photo and uploading it. She has not heard from you. So this afternoon she called the main HSBC number for help. After 60 minutes of being on hold she ended the call. She then called the number that was on the form, despite being continually informed that she was in a priority queue, after 90 minutes of being on hold, she ended the call. That is two and half hours of lost time. We have never experienced such a poor service from any organisation before. What do you suggest?

So on the 13-10-2020 i applied for a Business bank account (after being made redundant). After numerous telephone calls spending hours on the phone, mostly on hold im informed that im unable to open a business account 21-10-2020. Ive been a customer for 20 years. The email suggested that a credit check was undertaken for borrowing !!! I do not wish to borrow any money or require any funding. Im now self employed new business and busy working unable to sped hours on hold waiting for answers being put through to this department that department. Ive tried the appeal on line form and it continually times out. I require an account so that my clients can pay me. Totally disgusted with the whole process. I tried to book an appointment with a local bank shut on Saturdays and 4pm in the week (i have to work). I spoke to a guy in business this morning and he tells me the application has been closed. Extremely annoyed. HSBC please contact me regarding opening an account to place funds into ASAP.

"Dear HSBC
 
 I have been on hold now for an hour with your telephone service. This is not an exaggeration. 
 
 Please would you arrange for a member of staff to answer the telephone."
Our so called HSBC gold plated pension after clawback is not worth a brass tack!
Changing Limited Liability debts to a sole trade account isn't fraud then HSBC? It's about time someone went public with your disgraceful and fraudulent activities. Not to mention laughable bounce back loan application timeframe.

Had enough of hsbc (not even worth caps lock!) You are not helpful in the slightest!
I don't need HSBC to tell me how to budget thank you, although I have had many financial reviews with HSBC. Pity their own Financial Planning Managers never mentioned HSBC would keep 22% of my small company pension for themselves when I reach State Pension age. I am a loyal employee with 43 years' service and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known. Shame on you HSBC. Do the right thing and get rid of this unfair out if date practice like the others have, CLAWBACK has no place in this modern world.
It’s rare I complain but feel frustrated. I’ve been to my local HSBC branch in Meadowhall only to find that now they are closed on a Saturday! Most people who are working can’t get to branch during the reduced hours on a Monday to Friday. Saturday is the only day I can get to pay in cash. It wouldn’t be so bad if there was a paying in machine outside the branch but there isn’t! How about close one day in the week and open on a Saturday to offer a service to working people.
HSBC - my husband (who doesn’t have Facebook) is at his wits end trying to get in touch. Been ringing for days and still waiting an hour later. He has just changed banks to yourself and the switching process is due to complete 6th November but no telephone banking number so can’t register online. Everything apart from that has arrived in the post. I have sent a PM but no response. Please can someone help
This is quite frankly sick.Read up on the record of HSBC and it's ethics......NOT much human rights there folks.....

I have been a victim of a scam and fraud and HSBC have told me I have to wait ten weeks before I may get my money back!!! This is ludicrous. I'm in my first year of trading as a sole trader and banks are supposed to help you. Instead I'm being punished for working hard. Definitely not leaving my money in my HSBC account again. Learn from your mistakes.
"1 hr on the phone to order a new card after a HSBC branch employee made a mistake and failed to order it a week ago, only for todays operator to hang up after an hour of dealing with the mistake.
 
 Still no card ordered. 🤬 
 
 HSBC_UK is there anyone
 competent in your organisation that wants to deal this problem? 😏"
Shame we didn’t have this advice over 40 years ago and known we were going to have to search down our sofas as Midland Bank/HSBC Staff Pension scheme was going to be “Clawed” back off us. I’m certain had loyal staff known this, or been advised of this from the beginning we would have changed our career paths, I know I would have. It’s a disgrace!
HSBC customer service is quite frankly disgusting at the moment. Organisations have had 7 months to put measures in place and yet still appallingly slow service is being blamed on COVID-19. Last week took 6 attempts to obtain a redemption statement, by the time it was finally sent the expiry date meant not enough time to complete on a new mortgage so back to square one. New one requested on 24th, here we are 6 days later and still no sign of it. Not good enough.
I’m with you. I’ve had an account for 40 years. Need to make an important payment. Have spent hours on the phone today - speaking to over 5 members of staff - line gone dead twice. For no reason they’ve decided that they don’t trust the payee despite my assurances that I have triple checked the details. Now suspended access to my bank account. Now saying that can’t make the payment until I’ve gone into a branch and proved my identity. No branches open this weekend. HSBC won’t let me use my account and jeopardising my future for no reason at all. Have put in a complaint but won’t be actioned in time. Disgraceful treatment of a long standing customer. I’m astonished that they would do this.

"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.
 Within 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - £4000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!
 HSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.
 Ontop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.
 HSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.

I applied for my feeder account so I can get my bounce back loan in May, I finally got it in August, I applied for my Bounce back loan, still no response. The financial implications of this slow response may hit me very hard. Too hard to be honest. HSBC is destroying my life with their incompetence
HSBC you should be ashamed of yourselves! We were all told what a brilliant pension we were agoing to get. But in reality it was all a sham! You were actually going to use the state pension to subsidise your own scheme! ie clawback the equivalent of the state pension from your hard working ex staff when they reach state pension age! Mainly effecting the lowest paid and predominantly women. Shame on you!

For more protection against fraud, don't use HSBCs online banking and don't trust their incompetent fraud department that blocks your transactions but allows fraudulent transactions and does nothing because they expect you to know all about it
I would like to know why HSBC have changed my name on my accounts to a name I have never been and now I am having trouble to sort them out because you want proof of my name to which I have never been but my mortgage is in the right name, all I want is the interest from paying my mortgage off early in a cheque that is in the right name so I can cash it and also why have you changed my name on my sons trust fund to the name I am not or have never been. I have filled in a change of name form over 3 weeks ago, I have given you all the proof you need to see that I am not that name, I have rang you up to have the phone put down on me, I have been in branch 3 times but you keep sending me letters in the name I have NEVER been
Well, I was going to complain about your telephone banking system, but it seems many many others have beaten me to it....no wonder your "experiencing a high number of calls"...all I would like is someone to call me back so I don't have to spend another hour getting through, only to be cut off by the HSBC staff I ended up talking to.

..my goodness, the service from HSBC is terrible. They don't seem to care, looking at the posts here. I've been trying to get through to discuss my mortgage - no luck whatsoever, from phone or chat
Would be able to manage my own future finances better if HSBC didn't clawback a large chunk of my pension when I reach 67, not something that was ever discussed with me.

I have unrecognised transactions on my account and nobody will refund them. They total £940.00 and it has made me overdrawn and unable to buy food. I am hungry and it's now 37 hours since I ate anything because HSBC is holding the money hostage from me
When is what HSBC termed state deduction (which staff presumed was the reduced pension we also suffer because we were contracted out for NI) not actually a state deduction? It’s when HSBC clawback 23% of my pension and unbelievably call it state deduction. I’ve now got 2 deductions. The real state deduction which affects my state pension and the unexpected STATE DEDUCTION which is actually HSBC robbing my already meagre bank pension and NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STATE. The biggest mistake of my life was to think HSBC was a reputable employer. It’s a shameful company that does not practise what it preaches.
If anyone want free music..but don't have a radio..call HSBC you get two hours of free music while you wait for someone to answer. 🤷🏻‍♂️ wish I had never gone with this bank.
Interesting advertisement. I have had many financial reviews with HSBC. Pity their own Financial Advisors never mentioned HSBC would keep a chunk of my relatively small company pension for themselves when I reached State Pension age. I was a loyal employee for almost 40 years and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known.

Hsbc your telephone and internet service is beyond a joke! Your can’t keep blaming Covid-19 your are the only company I have had such horrendous problems with and your wait time is awful
Heres how to use it wisely. Bank with any bank.. anyone but HSBC
"Still no contact from

 Mr Hugh Pugsley- Counsel-what do we have to do?
 Without customer service Banks have nothing
 Mr Noel Quinn –CEO-What do we have to do?
 IF GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU
 Do not repeat do not BANK with HSBC
 Otherwise you will end being treated like my 83 year old father"
So, I took over as Chair of a Community Group which have an account with HSBC in Feb. In September, believing the bank would by now be contact-able to sort out bank accounts. Over 90 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered, unclear forms to fill out and then a letter sent to the wrong address saying it was done wrong and to phone the original number. Now back waiting on the same phone number again just to get in contact with someone. Such bad service. Unless things are resolved, our organisation will be moving accounts - that is if we can actually get in touch with someone! So bad - avoid if you are a community group :-(
Its not their money so how are they expected to care, i made a purchase from a scam company where they asked only for the postage on the sample, in the same transaction that company took £163 membership (not agreed)charge. HSBC no help at all.
Just under three hours on hold trying to get through regarding BBLS (5 months and counting) and then I got disconnected once someone answered. Shocking. How anyone has stayed with HSBC as a customer is beyond me. I have emailed you using the response email someone posted below, hoping someone will do the decent thing and respond to me...
I applied to HSBC bounceback loan in july. I got a conformation email and since have had nothing. I have spent 7 hours in total listening to the mind warping music on hold and have not spoken to anyone and have a business account with HSBC. Shocking!
Go away HSBC/. Just concentrate on running a legitimate business first instead of these surface pr soundbites....
Very disappointed with the abysmal customer service at the HSBC in Harrow, London, this afternoon. Two apparent customer service 'assistants' barked at me to queue TWICE from outside the bank because I needed to use two machines inside the bank, to withdraw and deposit money from my accounts! In addition, two of the three deposit machines inside the bank did not work! I refused to queue twice or give any credence to two rude, jumped up, good for nothing customer service agents and as a result HSBC missed out on my deposit and most likely my future business! Perhaps HSBC should divert resources into maintaining their 'self service' machines instead of employing unhelpful assistants that are obsessed with marshalling queues, lost on a deluded mini power trip and have an unnerving propensity to shout at their customers!#SHOCKING-SUB-STANDARD-CUSTOMER-SERVICE!

You talk about dreams but you are destroying mine.. Im heartbroken that you've undervalued my flat by 20,000. I adopted a dog who's owner is now too ill too take him back and I've fallen in love with him but I can't keep him in my flat so I was buying a house which has now fallen through because you have undervalued my flat so much. Please help me and reconsider HSBC
HSBC I tell you what we are tired of, the bank trying to portray itself as the best at this, the best at that, and still ripping off it's pensioners by taking part of their state pension. You say it was "part of the scheme and clearly communicated". Hogwash !! Many ex staff won't get a full state pension anyway because you contracted us all out but conveniently forgot to say that means you will get a reduced state pension. The only thing you are best at is dumping on your staff from a great height, you'd win awards for that.
Never open account in HSBC .this is worse bank in the world They blocked my account one year ago because someone transferred £90 and complaint that she did not received item.I provide them all the details and they are not responding every day i hold for 2 hours and than they tell me that higher investigation team is looking into this matter and they will come back. Every day i go to bank. their only response is higher team is looking this matter
Been waiting over a month for our new business account to be activated! Can't speak to anyone, hold on the phone for hours. Told we will get updates on email and we get nothing. How can a new business survive these tricky times if we can't invoice our jobs??? Can anyone at HSBC actually help me with this?? Not just an answer phone telling me to press number after number to be told they won't discuss business accounts down the bloody phone!!!!!
Taking of Fairer tales. How about the one concerning a female branch clerk who has given 40 years of her life to the bank, some part-time and some full-time, who retires on a pension of £15k a year, only to find the bank claw back 30% of that when she hits State Pension Age - compared to a senior male manager who retires on £150k a year but inly has 2% a year clawed back from his huge pension. HSBC claim that is fair and equitable! See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk
Yep and HSBC doing very little to help solve this. What is your fraud line number and how quick to you respond?
It is a scam what HSBC is doing to their staff's pensions! #fightforfairness
Hey I can't access an account for a vulnerable person as her appointed POA, I never ever wanted to use HSBC but I have to respect the wishes of this customer, my HSBC card is actually issued in the wrong name even though I produced all my documents at a local branch 18 miles away.i refused to go back with the same documents as life is too short
So disappointed with HSBC. My daughter has just reported a fraud on her account and has spent two days on the 'phone trying to get it resolved. "Halifax", on the other hand, who were also involved have been fantastic
Thought I did budget for my retirement until I found out HSBC will clawbank some of my staff pension. Shame on you HSBC we were told how great our pensions were and it was all part of our package/salaries.
Been on the phone to Hsbc for the last 2 evenings trying to get a refund for my son!! Your staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. My son now will have bank charges through no fault of his own!! Things are difficult enough at present with the global pandemic without being robbed of money people don’t have! Every other bank/business are trying to help people but Hsbc are not helpful at all in fact the attitude of the 7 staff that I’ve already spoken to over the last 2 days is disgusting! I’m hoping I can get someone to help me today before my son gets any further into debt thanks to Hsbc 😡
It would be great if you could answer your customer service line. I’ve been cut off many times in the last few days after I’ve been waiting 30 minutes plus. Not a great way to treat your customers. I’ve sent a direct message now. Let’s hope someone reads it and get backs to me. Awful service by HSBC!
"RE: HSBC Sudbury- WHEN YOU THINK THINGS CAN'T GET ANY WORSE
 Just been into my local branch Sudbury –Suffolk
 What a bunch of fools
 One person at the window
 Didn’t know if the cash machine outside was working or not
 Go outside to change the PIN number to find it cash machine was out of order- just fill it with money – that is not too difficult !!!
 No-Manager in the branch - JUST Darren Witt-Senior Customer Services Officer-Who hid out the back
 You could not make it up !!!!
 EVERYBODY PLEASE REMEMBER HSBC stands for:
 HATE
 SPEAKING (or being)
 BOTHERRED (by)
 CUSTOMERS
 
 Instead of paying tens of thousands of pounds for non execs who clearly have NO OVERSIGHT or GOVERNANCE over the bank
 Pay a few internal people to carry out a SERVICE AUDIT I think you might be surprised by the findings MR QUINN and MR TUCKER"
WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it’s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar
HSBC have a pretty bad record full stop. Highly UNRECOMMEND
So we are being taught to budget by HSBC. How ironic. Their employees budget carefully for retirement only to find that at state pension age HSBC claw money back from their pensioners who then have to budget again because they have less money. HSBC think that it is acceptable because it was ‘clearly communicated’ when we all joined the bank many years ago. Funny that they won’t provide definitive proof of this as these pensioners only found about this ‘state deduction’ as HSBC call it as it started affecting some many years later and after many years of loyal service. Look to your business morals HSBC as other companies did many years ago and reverse this state deduction. #fightingforfairness
Shame on you HSBC, I thought I had budgeted for my retirement, only to find out I was 'losing' £125 a month from my small pension, I'm lucky enough to have a husband with a pension as I'm pretty sure I couldn't manage without him and our joint pensions, really feel for anyone on their own trying to manage. Shame on you HSBC!!!!!
And still nothing Sarah. This is disgraceful. I've urgently asked for an Email address for complaints, but no reply as yet. Being an HSBC customer used to be a pleasure, but its not the bank I joined 40 years ago

 Canadian tar sands controversy
 Oil sands are significantly more polluting than other forms of oil extraction (Emily Beament/PA)
 According to data analysed by ShareAction, Barclays has sunk an estimated US$3.2 billion (£2.4 billion) into oil sands since 2016, followed by HSBC at $2.6 billion (£2 billion).
 
 Both Barclays and HSBC this year announced a commitment to become net zero banks by 2050, although they have been criticised for a lack of detail in their policies.
 
 ShareAction revealed that since its net zero commitment in March, Barclays has participated in 11 deals to oil sands companies, including those which are building extra capacity pipelines.
 
 Elsewhere, analysis 24 of Europe’s largest banks revealed none had set out specific steps to phase out investment in oil sands.
 
 As well as the reputational damage, ShareAction warns investments risk becoming stranded assets as oil demand falls, as oil sands production costs can be as much as double that of conventional crude.
 
 The report’s authors likened banks’ commitment to oil sands to “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller” given the high risks and low returns.
 
 One of the authors, Xavier Lerin, told the PA news agency: “Why banks are so committed to these (projects)"
I'll be shutting my account HSBC down being associated with charity and the bbc
"Appalled and utterly dissapointed at how terrible hsbcs customer service has become. Wasting a vast amount of my time and repeatedly giving me the wrong information. 
 What caused this level of incompetence and uselessness?"

Hi , HSBC award winning service again .. waited 90 mins on the morgage help line to have someone pick the phone up and then put it down!! Excelleclnt service again !! Keep up the bad work !!
HSBC is a joke been trying to get through for 4 months yes 4 MONTHS on hold again tonight for an hour far too stressful been banking with you for 30 years you are a disgrace if you opened for more than 4 hours day I would withdraw all money and close my account
HSBC Bloody useless bank! Been waiting nearly 12 weeks for bounce back loan, chased sign-off docs, signed them three weeks ago, was told money would be in account within 48 hours, still nothing! AND that is after chasing it up upteen times, Bank Manager been on the case for last week, he's getting no-where, apparently. Anyone thinking of joining this bank should think twice, as I know lots of people leaving it! I have been with the bank for 35 years, when it was Midland Bank, since becoming HSBC, it has slowly gone down hill to an incompetent mess!
"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.
 Within 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - £4000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!
 HSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.
 Ontop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.
 HSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.
 I HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY GET SHUT DOWN!"
An hour on chat to try to get a new bank card. An hour on the phone. Then they cancel the wrong card so I have no cards. Sons ill. Grocery delivery will be cancelled and a world of difficulty. The solution? “Borrow some money from a friend.” What has happened to you HSBC? Customer service used to be amazing. Now the wait to speak to someone is horrendous. Chat doesn’t work as they’re doing multiple conversations at once, I’m just waiting for 45 minutes just for someone to acknowledge that I’m waiting. I’m on hold again now, 16 minutes into yet another call to again request that my joint account card is reissued.

What a joke of a Bank.Had a fraud alert sent to me from HSBC and guess what...... can’t get hold of anyone, just constantly on hold.Moved all the money out of my HSBC account into my Halifax account and to be honest that’s where it will stay.Dreadful service!!!
Dear HSBC, could someone from the “very responsive” to messages please respond to the messages have been sending for tye the past twenty minutes? I can’t phone you as I don’t have phone banking set Up,I can’t access my account and i I cannot get any help/support from you. Is anyone there?
"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.
 
 Got through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!
 
 HSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.
 
 TIME FOR THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMEN!"
It’s a shame when you say you’re open, but when you call it say, this office is now closed. 🤦🏻‍♀️ worst banking ever. Wish I was left to open the bank account because it would’ve not been HSBC
"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November. Consequently I have this week spent a total of 6 hours and 10 minutes in phone calls with Barclaycard over a 4 day perios who have also confirmed the information given by HSBC was inaccurate. Subsequently I have once again this afternoon phoned HSBC only to be CUT OFF for the second time after forty minutes. 
 
 This has now left me with no other option than to contact:
 1: The financial ombudsman 
 2. BBC Watchdog
 3: A researcher I know personally who works for a well known TV show that exposes and brings to public attention situations like this.
 
 It's absolutely astounding that all I wanted to do was make a simple balance transfer! 
 
 If you are going to employ cheap monkeys to operate a business, you can expect to turn into a zoo, which judging by the reviews here, you've succeeded. 
 
 Absolutely appalling service."
This Racist History Month HSBC is doing what it always does and virtue signalling while doing absolutely nothing to help customers during coronavirus
Only scammers are hsbc them selfs
I know what I won’t be doing, is logging on to my accounts as HSBC make it impossible for me to do so!! What a joke of a company

I've been with HSBC for over 20 year, Well not for much longer. Crap customer service, stupid security questions like "where did you spend £x two weeks ago last Thursday". I'm now looking to move banks.
This is the third credit check HSBC has done on my current account, with regards to opening my business bank account, never had so many credit checks done on me, left a mark in my credit history you bet they have. This has been going on for 19 weeks, it will be 20 weeks this week. Promise after promise “it’s at quality control, so should be open this week never week at the latest” lies and more lies. Two hours a day I spend on the phone every day getting this sorted, when I should be running my business, to get nothing and the guy today wasn’t even trying to be nice. Bet I get a generic reply to this, because they can’t even face the people they are letting down.
