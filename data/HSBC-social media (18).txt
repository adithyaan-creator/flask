@Bounce_BackLoan I read them. Only because I want to post my next HSBC acronym but I still read them.
HSBC is set to intensify the biggest shake-up in its 155-year history, putting even more jobs at risk. The bank had already announced it was axing 35,000 posts this year as it shrinks European and US operations and scales back its investment bank. Stay tuned &amp; Safe.

@HSBC_UK Hi Desi can you also pass my question on too? I've been waiting three days for an answer
I need to go to the bank with photo ID, I only have a picture of my passport on my phone. Will they accept that in the branch? 2 people on the phone have said yes I have a utility bill as well as 2 letters from the bank @HSBC_UK @HSBC @HSBCUKBusiness

@HSBC_UK is this normal? It takes (5) days before my debit status is updated. Assuming that i still have enough money in my account, but due to delayed update i ended up zeroed or over over drafted.
@Bounce_BackLoan I have a call with HSBC on Tuesday to open feeder account because the situation with Barclays has now turned into a Monty Python sketch ,not even their own executive team seem to be able to get handle on what is going on..
@IanCurran10 @Bounce_BackLoan I started the process of a feeder account with HSBC 3 weeks ago, I bank with tide so hopefully one of them will come through.
@Huawei Meng is charged with bank and wire fraud in the U.S. for misrepresenting Huawei's relationship with a subsidiary doing business in Iran to HSBC, which U.S. authorities say processed financial transactions that violated U.S. sanctions. She is an international criminal.
@Bounce_BackLoan As any body seen a feeder account I havenâ€™t and I got paid from Hsbc do you mean a draw down account
@Bounce_BackLoan Only one person in Hsbc has been paid by them for non Hsbc customers. As far as Iâ€™m aware, Iâ€™ll be next, so 2nd
@Bounce_BackLoan Iâ€™ve been on to HSBC for a feeder account today ðŸ™ðŸ» that might be quicker than Tide
@Bounce_BackLoan Has anyone had any luck opening a HSBC basic personal account and then gone on to apply for a BBL?

@eaglewa90656657 @acoyne The charge is that she's committed fraud. Under Canadian law, it's fraud when you lie to someone and thereby put them at risk of a significant loss (even when there's no actual loss). Lying to HSBC put them at risk of being hit with &gt;$1B in penalties.
@molkoreports @CTVVancouver If it was fraud against HSBC, which is a Hong Kong and London based bank, what has it got to do with US and Canada? And can Justice Holmes guarantee that when #MengWanzhou get extradited to the US, she will only be charged with fraud?

@NovemberMatters @Larry_Beech @JarradKushner Ok good. So in Loretta's case, the HSBC case, HSBC was busted by an employee who found that the coding prevented search results.

The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment to Iran in violation of US sanctions. It says Meng, 48, committed fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran.
@kalmondair You're Welcome ðŸ™‚ .^Margie.
OK a few smaller banks are Money Dropping, my eyes are on HSBC if they do a night time one its in the next hour or two usually.
More from the ruling: "I cannot agree with Ms. Meng that to refer to US sanctions in order to understand the risk to HSBC is to allow the essence of the conduct to be defined by foreign law. Canadaâ€™s laws determine whether the alleged conduct, in its essence, amounts to fraud" 2/

@great_snark @mamafax @SteveB09904942 @BradTJensen @jenniferatntd The *only* reason HSBC inquired about the dealings is because of US sanctions. Had this deal taken place in Canada, her *alleged* actions would have caused no harm to HSBC. Hence, not fraud, definition of fraud - deception to secure *unfair, unlawful* gain

"@KayLeos @mamafax @SteveB09904942 @BradTJensen @jenniferatntd The fact of the Sanctions is not foundational, as the court found.

@HSBC_UK fao Saffron. My issue was made as a complaint on 7th May and closed on the 8th. We are beginning to think the only way to get this resolved is to issue a CCJ against HSBC.

@michaelblackcab @ToxicLemon69 @Bounce_BackLoan @IllLeaveMyMark @HSBC Donâ€™t waste your time calling.

@EddieYue #EddieYue sir, HSBC HK is involved in racial discrimination by selectively closing accounts of Indian origin people &amp; their HK Co's without reasons. More then 100,000 accounts closed in last 3 years. No reason given just block the account with millions in accounts.
@AspelsGroup @Unique_Treble @Bounce_BackLoan @BladeIPTVuk If I can look at it dispassionately for a moment then any of the banks that have paid out so far whoever they are have helped a business. I know it isn't free money but they are helping small businesses stay afloat. Now back to being really angry at HSBC!

@AspelsGroup @Unique_Treble @Bounce_BackLoan @BladeIPTVuk Agreed. I find myself shocked at typing this but for me HMRC have performed better than HSBC. I was just illustrating that Tide is not really a bank and is using an e payments platform to distribute funds basically no different to PayPal capital
Economic scalpel attacks on Hong Kong mean an immediate destabilizing of banks that are integral to the British economy, such as HSBC. It's a non-starter. The UK is much more deeply integrated into Hong Kong than the United States.

Hello @HSBC_IN I have been charged late payment fee due to non payment of the credit card bill within due date. I agree that the mistake was from my side, but I request you to reverse the late payment charges since this happened for the first time. Kindly look into it.

@GuyOpperman Not as easy as that. For starters, you need to have an exsisting account with Santander before applying. If you donâ€™t, then they will decline your application. I think that applies to most apart from HSBC as a temporary feeder account is set up before applying
