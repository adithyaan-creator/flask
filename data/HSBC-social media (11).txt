@BizzyRascal @HSBCUKBusiness @FT @RishiSunak Yes Saif I agree , applied yesterday and nowt mate not even a we have your application and we will get back to you , now Barclays on the other hand, what a bank pay you out straight away 24 hours , now thats customer service mate shame Hsbc being pumped by another bank lol
@GuyInAfrica @MartinSLewis @HSBC_UK I know itâ€™s probably a stupid question but have you checked your junk email? I set a credit card up with them and my electronic sig email was in there.

@MartinSLewis I applied via @HSBC_UK yesterday morning. Havenâ€™t received the email to confirm electronic signature, canâ€™t get thruâ€™ online to chat to them and ask if theyâ€™ve received application, had a Twitter message that itâ€™ll take several days. Santander did it in a day for a friend. Help.

@IainDale @HSBC_UK All banks should be accelerating acceptance if the government are backing the loans.
So @HSBC_UK now telling small business who have applied for Bounceback loans that instead of people getting approved and getting their money within 48 hours, they won't give a timescale due to volume of applications. Not good enough.
HSBC MF marked down the remaining 25% of distressed DHFL NCDs held in its 2schemes - 'Short Duration' and 'Low Duration' funds. It has led to a single day fall in NAV by 9% &amp; 9.7% respectively on 8th May. Earlier in June2019, AMC had marked down 75% of DHFL NCDs in those schemes

@Bounce_BackLoan @EvoSupplies1 @Naseinternatio1 @BrianMyrieSalsa I have heard HSBC are working over the weekend and seems like they were working yesterday too, I'm expecting that they might start picking up applications faster now
@Bounce_BackLoan Someone on my facebook said they applied to hsbc on monday, not heard anything , rang them and they hadn't received it so she had to apply again. Despite having the 'you've submitted your application' screen. Could be an issue for some it seems.
@Bounce_BackLoan Anyone applied later than monday that have received the loan? I applied on Friday after being a bit hesitant, my business account isn't with HSBC but I have personal banking with them
@Bounce_BackLoan Thanks! Fingers crossed everyone gets an update soon. Grateful for the help but lack of communication from HSBC has really messed my head up on top of a very stressful time. Thanks to you for giving people a place to share experiences and info! Doesn't feel like we're so alone x

@RobbHughes @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness I'm the same. Wouldn't be so bad if there was a few quid left in the account. Sadly the little guys are getting screwed this time whilst the banks top dogs are sitting comfy in their mansions
@danwaddell I walked past HSBCâ€™s cricket ground in Beckenham (across the way from Kentâ€™s outground) the other day and thought similar.
@ChrisRevelo @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness Iâ€™ve sent a complaint to uk.business@hsbc.com and still heard nothing back, theyâ€™re just ignoring us. They donâ€™t keep to promises.

@RobbHughes @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness @HSBCUKBusiness have been useless. I also applied Mon morning and have business banking with them but have heard zero back. Call centre has been no help and they havenâ€™t replied to my emails.
@HSBC_IN I have given a request for the security device for my credit card. It is almost 1 week. When will I receive it?
@paulkendall53 @ClaireLYoung @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @Barclays My friend got his within 24 hours via @santanderuk
@BarkingMadClare @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness They must just be randomly selecting them, another driving instructor - applied the same time as me, only had a personal account with HSBC but has got his funds.... it makes me angry as it seems like they are picking and choosing who to save....
@HSBC_IN since morning I am facing issues while making payments using hsbc credit card on amazon. It has failed multiple times. Please fix. See the screenshot https://t.co/NmJc7cJAhm
@HSBC The set up looks kind of laughable actually... other banks provide dealer boards, a full set up exactly the same as being at the desk and with a video screen so youâ€™re all looking at each other.
@BBCBreaking @BBCNews @ITV @itvnews @Channel4News @SkyNewsBreak @SkyNews @SkyNewsBiz @hmtreasury Our small businesses canâ€™t wait any longer, because of @HSBC_UK @HSBCUKBusiness theyâ€™re killing our businesses!
@RobbHughes @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness More people seem to be saying theyâ€™re coming through now but god knows the order theyâ€™re doing it in and why at least an auto generated reply wasnâ€™t sent?!
@HSBCMsia Could you inform swift code of HSBC Penang
@1_Pipster @PaulChantler @AnneBoden If it is any use HSBC have been the worst bank for complaints this week, bar Barclays and their techie problems.
@Sw11Wayne @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness Itâ€™s so sad to hear this :( Iâ€™ve tried to be patient... but checking every 30 seconds is killing me and my phone battery!
@Bounce_BackLoan @PaulChantler @AnneBoden HSBC been useless so far. I have made five or six phone calls to them over the week and got precisely nowhere. Just promises that do not materialise.
@BarkingMadClare @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness I understand they are inundated but surely just an email to say, yep we got it! Other people who applied after us have received their money.... how? Why?
@RobbHughes @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness You are in the same boat as most of us. I think it's a lost cause and my business is basically done after this weekend as cash flow is now dead.
"@HSBC_UK How long will it take to get an answer about the bounce back loan? I applied last monday. Many thanks.
 
 Ben Turp"
@RobbHughes @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK @MonzoBusiness I also applied Monday and I am a business customer with them. Iâ€™ve heard absolutely nothing!
@mrminig Yup the first email is the one attached from HSBC which came 3 days after the application https://t.co/jUbcMepyFv
@thesolerestocks I left HSBC after this happened to me for the React 87s
@HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK come on! I applied on Monday morning for a bounce back loan (BBLS) I am a personal customer as I bank with @MonzoBusiness, but had no reply nor any other correspondence. Whatâ€™s going on?
@EvoSupplies1 @Bounce_BackLoan Just a heads up to everyone, might be better to use "Internet Explorer" when completing the initial application as there are certain issues with completing the application using Chrome hence why you may not recieve the email from HSBC. Worked for us.
Interesting week for HSBC in one ðŸ– unlike other banks their taking applications for BBL from personal &amp; others not just existing business bank customers, which is purely what others are approving! Downside havenâ€™t paid anyone yet so annoying everyone!! #bouncebackloan #HSBC
@HSBC_UK please can you give me a link to request a new code generator thingy for mobile banking, and also to request a new pin?
@Bounce_BackLoan Client of mine received HSBC this morning. Applied tuesday AM, no contact whatsoever, but cash arrived
2020-05-08 Short sale volume (not short interest) for $CHAP is 58%. https://t.co/nzeNARvMrl $HSBC 58% $SBUX 63% $NAIL 42% $KEY 59%
@HSBC_UK With the reduction of the Bank of England rates, banks have reduced their interest rates on existing savings accounts, thatâ€™s understandable. How come they have not reduced rates on existing loans?
@cityofyabook Hi Lisa, sorry to hear about this. I will definitely look in to this and try my best to find out what's going on if you can pass me your full name and postcode through a direct message. ^Sam
@Priyank43539144 Hello Ms.Verma, Sorry to hear that. We certainly wouldnâ€™t want you to experience this when it comes to our customer service. We understand your concern. Kindly share the 10 digit complaint reference number once you receive. We can have this checked for you on priority.^ Lalitha
@mrminig I had asked HSBC about my BBL application on Tuesday they said they had no record of it, but that was not unusual due to the volume of applications. Their communication is terrible &amp; timings illogical, but they seem to be getting there. I'd wait till Monday to chase just in case
@HSBC @HSBC_UK Thank you HSBC https://t.co/IPC3ctvTTH

@mortgagealexuk @RishiSunak @TideBusiness Itâ€™s not for me personally, but as it stands there are only 14 lenders, and it is currently only HSBC facilitating non-customers, although as far as im aware there isnâ€™t anyone who asked for a â€œfeeder accountâ€ who has yet to hear anything back.
@HSBC_UK I just phoned you, my #bank to be told the call was going to cost me Â£9! - guess what? Iâ€™m switching banks today. #ripoff #robbery #Exploit #Covid_19
@chatsfield @Bounce_BackLoan I have never needed the bank apart from money in and out, other banks turned it around in 24 hours, why couldnâ€™t HSBC. For me itâ€™s the lack of communication thatâ€™s the issue, if they said received 2 weeks then at least you know where you stand, that is the issue for many.
#bouncebackloans #bouncebackloan #Hsbc Hsbc def seem to be working over the weekend, Applied for a BBL on Monday, no contact till Thursday email, saying that an agreement would be sent through by 'echosign', received offer email to sign this morning. Very Relieved!

"@nw_nicholas Bit of a strawman saying ""every country in the world"", just Gates Foundation/WHO. The level of Gates control over them &amp; intertwining of interests isn't unlike HSBC's behaviour that you yourself have uncovered.

I think many customers after all this will be looking for a new business bank once a bit of normality returns.
@ClaireLYoung @Bounce_BackLoan @HSBCUKBusiness @HSBC_UK Glad itâ€™s not just @Barclays. I know that doesnâ€™t help you @ClaireLYoung. For argument sake, say we have received the loan and it was time to pay back: â€œDonâ€™t panic @Barclays, I canâ€™t find your money but Iâ€™m confident itâ€™s thereâ€...I wonder how that would go down? ðŸ¤”
